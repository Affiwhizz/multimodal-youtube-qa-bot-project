# multimodal-youtube-qa-bot-project
I’m building a multimodal AI system that can take any YouTube cooking video, extract the transcript, index the content into a vector database, and allow users to ask natural-language questions about the video. The goal is to turn long videos into searchable, interactive knowledge.  This project uses a full RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
