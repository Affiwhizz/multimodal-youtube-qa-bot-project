to Masimo and I have something really
0:02
special for you today. This recipe has
0:04
stayed secret for 95 years in my family.
0:06
My grandmother was making it to me as a
0:08
kid and now I'm ready to share it with
0:10
you. Today we make real Italian home.

0:27
So, we know the noki are made of simple
0:29
ingredients like most Italian dishes.
0:31
But some hidden secret makes all the
0:34
difference. Get them right and your no
0:36
will be soft, pillowy, perfect every
0:38
time. Get them wrong and they will turn
0:41
dense and chewy. Just unatable. Let's
0:43
dive together in the recipe to check out
0:45
what those secrets are. Noki is one of
0:47
those dishes that feels like home. Soft,
0:49
pillowy, and packed with flavor. When
0:51
made right, they're pure comfort food. I
0:53
grew up making no with my old
0:55
grandmother right here in our farm in
0:56
Italy. And today I'm sharing our family
0:59
recipe with you. The secret it's all
1:01
about precision. Just like baking, noki
1:03
follow specific ratio to stay soft
1:05
inside instead of dry. Stick to those
1:07
percentages and you'll have a perfect
1:09
noki every time. Let's get started. The
Potatoes
1:12
first step is choosing the right
1:13
potatoes. You want the driest variety
1:15
you can find. Starchy potatoes like
1:17
ruset work best because they absorb less
1:20
water. Those I found in a supermarket in
1:22
Italy say they were made for noki. So I
1:24
have decided to give them a try. We
1:26
start by peeling the potatoes and
1:28
boiling them in slightly salted water
1:29
until they're tender but not falling
1:31
apart. We start from cold water. So
1:33
eating up gradually allows the starch in
1:35
the potatoes to cook more evenly. A key
1:37
detail here. Wait the amount of the
1:39
potatoes requested in the recipe just
1:41
after they're cooked, ensuring the
1:43
balance of ingredients stay tastes
1:44
perfect. Turn on the fire to high, close
1:46
the pot and let it do its job. While the
1:48
potatoes are cooking, we start preparing
Egg mixture
1:50
the rest of the ingredients. This is an
1:52
important step because each ingredients
1:54
plays a role in the final texture of the
1:56
noki. Let's start with the breadrumbs.
1:58
We want them finally ground so they will
2:00
mix well together in the dough without
2:01
making it grainy. You can also use a
2:03
storebought breadcrumbs, but I prefer to
2:05
make my own by drying out some good
2:07
quality bread and blending it into a
2:09
fine powder. For this, you could use a
2:11
hand grater as well. But to get a fine
2:13
powder that kind of hide inside the
2:16
noki, I prefer using an electric mixer.
2:18
So, we break the bread into bigger
2:20
chunkas and toss it into the mixer.
2:22
Close, activate, and let it do its job.
2:24
Next, the cheese. Here we're using
2:26
parmyano regano, finally grated. Freshly
2:29
grating makes a big difference. It melts
2:31
better into the dough and gives a richer
2:33
taste. Take your time with this step. A
2:35
fine grate helps it blend evenly. Around
2:37
30 minutes before blending, I place my
2:39
parvigano into the freezer. Cold, firm
2:42
pieces blend finally and cleanly. Now,
2:44
the eggs. Since I'm on a farm, I like
2:47
using fresh eggs straight from our
2:49
chickens. Crack three whole eggs into a
2:51
bowl, making sure there are no bits of
2:53
shell. Then add the 10 g of fine salt
2:55
and whisk everything together. Once the
2:57
eggs are smooth, we stir in the
2:59
breadcrumbs first and incorporate. Then
3:01
we add the parmesan organo. This mix
3:03
need to sit for a few minutes. Why?
3:05
Because the breadcrumbs will absorb the
3:07
egg and cheese, making a thick paste
3:09
that will help bind our noki together
3:12
without making them dance. This is the
3:14
beauty of homemade noki. You get to see
3:16
each step come together. Once the
Squeeze and incorporate
3:18
potatoes are ready and still warm, we
3:20
need to mash them properly. Never use a
3:22
blender, food processor, or a fork.
3:24
Those will leave chunks or make the
3:25
potatoes gluey. Instead, use a potato
3:28
ricer or a fine food meal to press them
3:30
into a large bowl. The goal is a light
3:32
fluffy texture, not mashed potato puree.
3:35
So, we gently move our potatoes to the
3:36
riser and squeeze everything into our
3:39
bigger bowl. While the potatoes are
3:40
still warm, we use a fine filter to add
3:43
300 gram of flour. We then add our egg
3:46
mixture. Using our hands or a wooden
3:48
spoon since it's still warm, we gently
3:50
combine everything until we have a
3:52
smooth, uniform dough. All right, what
3:54
is the key here? The key is not to knead
3:56
the dough like bread. Kneading the dough
3:58
too much will activate the gluten in the
4:00
flour and will make your noki chewy
4:01
instead of light and soft. So you need
4:03
to stop mixing as soon as everything is
4:06
just well incorporated. Look at this.
4:08
Another tip. Never add extra flour
4:10
inside the dough. The range is between
4:12
20 to 30% flour marks depending on the
4:15
potatoes you get. Today we are doing 20.
4:17
It might feel stick at first, but adding
4:19
too much flour will make the noki dry.
4:22
Instead, we only use extra flour to dust
4:24
the surfaces. We proceed by adding flour
4:26
to the top of the dough and our prep
4:28
table where we gently move our dough to.
4:30
Once it's there, we dust the top again
Shaping gnocchi
4:32
and gently shape the dough into a large
4:34
sausage. From there, we divide it into
4:36
smaller sections, rolling each one into
4:38
a thin rope about the width of a finger.
4:41
Once we have our long ropes, we cut them
4:43
into small, even sized pieces. If you
4:46
want the classic ridge shape, roll each
4:48
piece over a board or the back of a
4:50
fork. It's optional, but in my opinion,
4:52
this helps the sauce holding better. We
4:55
lightly dust them with flour to prevent
4:57
sticking, but remember, not too much.
4:59
Those noki are delicate and that's what
5:01
makes them special. Those noki are not
5:04
like supermarket one. They absorb
5:05
humidity incredibly fast, so they should
5:08
be boiled right after making them or
5:10
either stored in the freezer for later
5:12
use. Bring a large pot of salted water
5:14
to a rolling boil. Drop in the noki and
5:16
wait. They'll start to float when
5:18
they're done. To freeze, lay them out on
5:20
a single layer on a tray, making sure
5:22
they're not touching. Once frozen,
5:24
transfer them to a bag or a container.
5:26
When you're ready to cook, you can drop
5:28
them straight from the freezer into
5:29
boiling water. Then follow the same
5:31
process of fresh ones. When the noki
Cooking the gnocchi
5:33
float, they are ready. Over cooking
5:35
makes them fell apart, so be ready with
5:37
your sauce. Remember that bolognese
5:39
sauce we made last time. Here is how we
5:41
bring it back to life. If you froze a
5:43
portion like I did, just take it out and
5:45
let it defrost in the fridge overnight.
5:47
Then warm it up in a pan over low heat
5:50
until it's bubbling again. This is
5:52
exactly why making extra bologn is a
5:54
great idea. It saves time and gives you
5:56
another amazing dish to enjoy. I will
5:58
drop a link if you are interested. So,
6:00
we warm up the sauce and once it's
6:02
ready, we lay it on top of the noki and
6:03
finish with more parban on top. All
6:06
right, done. This is the kind of dish
6:08
that makes a meal feel like home. Is the
6:10
recipe my grandmother made with love and
6:12
now it's yours too. Take your time, cook
6:14
with care, and share it with someone you
6:16
love. And that's it. Homemade soft and

6:22
be proud. If you enjoyed this video, hit
