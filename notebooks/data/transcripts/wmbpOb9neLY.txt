hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with garlic none that's right we
0:08
posted a lot of flat breads on the channel like pita bread flour tortillas
0:12
mountain bread and i'm sure a few others as well but i've never done a video for
0:17
what is probably my favourite flatbread and that would be garlic nom so that's
0:21
what we're attempting to do today and it can be challenging without the super hot
0:25
tandoor oven but I think I've come up with a pretty decent technique for doing
0:29
these in the home kitchen as you're gonna see relatively soon but before we
Making the Garlic Butter
0:33
get to that we have to start our dough which will begin as usual with some very
0:36
warm but not too hot water into which we will add a little bit of white sugar as
0:41
well as one packet of dry active yeast and what we'll do is just let that sit
0:46
there for about ten to fifteen minutes to sort of give that yeast a head start
0:49
and also to test if it's alive and what we can do while we're waiting for that
0:53
is move on to make our garlic butter which we'll start by melting one stick
0:57
of butter over medium heat in the small pan if for the record I'm making way
1:00
more than I need for this recipe since there's like forty other things we
1:04
can use that for and what we'll do once that melts is wait for it to sing before
1:09
we add our garlic and what I mean by saying is that we're waiting for this
1:12
summer all right you do that and once our butter starts doing that we'll go
1:19
ahead and stir it up and a lot of it that was like four giant clubs and we
1:24
will quickly mix that in and immediately turn off the heat all right very
1:28
important we really don't want to cook the garlic too much so basically as soon
1:32
as we add it and stir it in we're gonna turn off our heat and we could just
1:36
leave that on the stove until we're ready to use it so our garlic butter is
1:39
set and we could head back to check out our East which as you can see was most
Making the Dough
1:43
certainly alive and I can tell because it looks like the head of a beer and
1:47
that's our signal it's okay to go ahead and add the rest of the ingredients
1:50
which will include a spoon of plain yogurt as well as some bread flour
1:55
although I'm pretty sure you can use all-purpose for this we will also toss
2:00
in some salt and then last but not least one tablespoon of our freshly made
2:04
garlic infused butter and once all that's in there we'll take a wooden
2:09
spoon and start mixing and we will keep mixing until we form what we call the
2:13
bit a shaggy doe which is gonna look a
2:16
little something like this and then what we'll do once we've
2:19
reached our shaggy doe stage is switched to our hand and we'll get in there and
2:24
we'll start pressing and pushing everything together until eventually we
2:27
can sort of start kneading and we'll keep doing that until basically
2:30
everything's been pulled off the sides of the bowl and we've sort of formed a
2:34
rough ball of dough and it might seem obvious but I'll tell you anyway if
2:38
things seem too dry and it's not coming together just add a little touch of
2:41
water or if it's too wet and sticky to come together just add a little more
2:45
flour okay that is just you cooking but anyway once it does come together like
2:50
this we'll go ahead and transfer that onto our table and we will need that for
Kneading
2:54
about three or four minutes until we have a fairly smooth a fairly elastic
2:58
dough and if you have to dust it with a little bit of flour go ahead but because
3:03
of that little bit of garlic butter we added it shouldn't really stick to the
3:06
table too much so we'll go ahead and keep kneading that as shown until like I
3:11
said we have something that's fairly smooth and it sort of springs back to
3:14
the touch so that is looking pretty good right there and once that's been
3:18
accomplished we will transfer that into a bowl and then we'll drizzle over a
3:22
little more of our garlic butter so we can coat our dough so it won't dry out
3:25
while it rises and of course you could use a little bit of oil like we usually
3:29
do but that butter was right there and then what we'll do once that set is
3:34
cover it and let it sit for about an hour to two hours or until it doubles in
3:38
size and generally does that have some fat in them like this one will take a
Shaping
3:43
little bit longer to rise so don't panic if this takes a little longer than
3:46
you're used to and after about two hours might look like this and then as usual
3:51
we'll go ahead and punch that down and transfer it onto our table where we are
3:56
quickly going to press it into some kind of rectangular shape or by the way any
3:59
semi-regular shape because the only reason we're doing this is to make it
4:03
easier to cut into six pieces with our bench scraper and theoretically if our
4:07
dough is a nice even size we should be able to cut our six portions into pretty
4:11
even sizes but of course having said that as you can see mine were not that
4:15
even which is fine because this is none and you do not want to trust a pile of
4:20
naan bread that's all exactly the same size all right we don't want this
4:24
looking like it came out of a machine which is clearly not going to be an
4:27
issue here but anyway once those are cuts we will use a cupped hand to sort
4:32
of rub those on the table in a circular motion so that we end up with six mini
4:36
dough balls and once that's done we'll go ahead and lightly dust those with
4:39
flour and then what we'll do is cover those with some plastic wrap and we will
4:44
let them sit there for about 15 to 20 minutes to proof which is just a fancy
4:48
baking word for a brief second rising and after about 15 or 20 minutes this is
4:53
what mine look like so yes in that short amount of time they will puff up a fair
4:57
amount and that's it once these are proofed
Rolling
5:00
we can start rolling those out on a very lightly floured surface and I generally
5:04
shoot for about an eighth of an inch thick and by the way feel free to make
5:08
these round if he wants but I believe traditionally these do have more of an
5:11
oval shape and besides an oval is easier than a circle but either way like I said
5:16
we'll roll that out to about an eighth of an inch at which point I'm gonna do
5:20
one optional step and that would be depressed and/or roll a little bit of
5:25
freshly chopped cilantro onto one side and for once my cilantro was nice and
5:29
dry and easy to use which made it a little bit harder to stick but that's
5:33
okay just press it or roll it on the best you can and again this is optional
5:37
so skip it if you want I mean you are after all this Chef John
5:40
of your garlic naan but I think it looks cool and provides more flavour so I do
5:45
it and that's it once our naan has been rolled and herbed we will head to the
5:49
stove where we will place that in an insanely hot cast-iron skillet okay so
5:54
preheat that on high and then once you think it's hot enough wait another five
5:58
minutes and that it's probably ready and you'll see as soon as you put that in
6:02
bubbles are going to start forming on the surface okay probably lots of little
6:07
ones and then a few random big ones and those bubbles are kind of key because
6:12
what's gonna happen after a couple minutes is we're gonna flip this and
6:16
we'll give it a gentle pressing with our spatula and ideally when we flip this
6:20
back over wherever those larger bubbles were there's going to be a perfect char
6:24
mark from the pan so we will flip that over and give the second side a couple
6:28
minutes at which point if everything's gone according to plan we should have
6:32
something that looks like this and the whole key here is make sure the pan was
6:36
smoking hot and then what we'll do to finish this is
Plating
6:39
we remove it from the pan just go ahead and brush that on both sides with our
6:43
warm garlic butter plus if you want you can spoon on some of that chopped garlic
6:47
and if you want some people like to sprinkle over a little coarse salt here
6:51
so suit yourself oh by the way if it looks like I'm
6:54
putting too much garlic butter on this I'm not that's just the light playing
6:58
tricks with your eyes Plus as this sits most of that will soak in although I'm
7:03
not going to give this one time to since I'm going in for the official taste
7:07
right now and hopefully what we've achieved here is something that's kind
7:11
of chewy but still tender with a little bit of random crispness here and there
7:15
from those charred blisters plus above and beyond the aforementioned amazing
7:20
texture we're talking about a substantial amount of buttery garlicky
7:23
goodness so yes maybe the world's best garlic bread is not actually garlic
7:28
bread it might be garlic naan and of course is your finishing one of these
7:33
you really should be singing nanananana nanananana hey goodbye but anyway after
7:44
ate that one I went ahead and did the rest
7:45
and like every flat bread at pancake and crepe the last couple you do will always
7:50
be better than the first few which is probably because the dough is rested
7:54
longer but also because your pan is probably getting hotter plus you've had
7:58
a few to practice on and that's it once we've cooked them all and piled them up
8:02
maybe we'll finish with a little more cilantro and that my friends is one
8:06
handsome plate of garlic naan and as amazing as that one I ate all by itself
8:10
was you put this next to some spicy curry like for example this creamy
8:15
cashew chicken curry that I'm probably going to show you very soon and you're
8:18
gonna take this experience up to a whole other level it's in like off-the-charts
8:22
delicious I mean if there's a better combination than a rich creamy aromatic
8:28
chicken curry paired with a crispy chewy buttery garlic naan I would really like
8:33
to know what that is but anyway that's it's my take on a home version of garlic
8:38
naan there's only one appropriate way I could
8:41
think to end this video no no no no actually I'm not gonna sing again and
8:46
I'll finish by simply saying I really do hope you give this a try soon so head
8:51
over to food which is calm for all the ingredient amounts of Morpho edges and
8:55
as always
9:15
you
