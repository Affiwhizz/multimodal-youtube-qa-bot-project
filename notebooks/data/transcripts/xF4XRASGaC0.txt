0:06
options for a traditional Syrian
0:09
breakfast welcome to bait Bushra I'm
0:11
Bushra and this is my home today we're
0:13
gonna make a Fete or we call it it's
0:16
made with as you guessed it chickpeas
0:19
and so you're gonna start your
0:20
preparations by soaking some chickpeas
0:23
overnight in some cold water with a
0:26
little bit of baking soda I like to use
0:28
dried chickpeas the written recipe will
0:30
be in the description box below for all
0:33
the measurements and the ingredients
0:35
after your chickpeas have been soaking
0:36
overnight you want to drain them and put
0:39
them with fresh water into a big pot and
0:42
simmer them until they're soft okay
0:44
toast some pita bread in the oven you
0:47
can also use an air fryer this is these
0:49
are the ingredients for your bed way so
0:51
Bedouin is very traditional
0:52
main part of any type of Fate really and
0:55
it starts with yogurt you need some
0:57
tayne tahini lemon juice and garlic
1:00
those are basic basic ingredients you
1:03
need some salt as well another way to do
1:05
this bed was to use pre-bas but we're
1:08
gonna make it here today
1:10
and just put all of your ingredients in
1:13
the food processor and pulse it up until
1:15
it's nice and creamy look at that tiny
1:17
knit I love tying it Tain is really good
1:19
so I know in like a little bit in some
1:22
smoothies try it and let me know it's so
1:24
creamy so we're gonna process this bed
1:27
way until it's nice and creamy like
1:30
hummus and then we're going to dilute it
1:33
with a little bit of the hummus
1:36
um liquid the liquid the cooking liquid
1:38
used for the chickpeas you're gonna
1:40
dilute it with a little bit of that
1:41
until it looks the consistency that you
1:44
just saw okay and now we're going to
1:46
assemble this you're going to start with
1:49
a preheated casserole dish and the pita
1:52
bread chips and then you're gonna put
1:54
some of the liquid cooking liquid and
1:57
some extra chickpeas you'll add the bed
1:59
to it and then you want to mix this
2:01
really well until that bread gets nice
2:03
and soaked your next layer is more
2:05
chickpeas in the middle and these look
2:09
so good can someone make it for me I'm
2:10
so right now
2:12
um
2:14
I'm gonna have the chickpeas and we're
2:15
gonna mix it a little bit again if you
2:16
like you can just make layers but um the
2:18
way we like it here we like to mix it
2:20
put a little bit more on top and then
2:23
you're going to finish with the bed
2:27
as your next layer so effective hummus
2:30
or this is very popular in Ramadan very
2:33
popular as the main dish for many
2:35
morning Syrian breakfast Levant area
2:38
breakfast
2:40
um and of course you can't make Arab
2:43
food without having a little bit of
2:44
decoration on top so we have pomegranate
2:46
seeds some parsley cumin or and paprika
2:50
I'm going to start by sprinkling my
2:53
paprika and then my cumin that's good
2:55
for anti-blooding also just the flavor
2:58
is really essential I think parsley
3:00
don't skip on that and it's so pretty
3:03
look at the red pomegranate they're sour
3:06
they're tart
3:07
and put some hummus in the middle there
