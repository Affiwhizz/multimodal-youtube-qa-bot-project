First of all, we have to prepare the chicken for this recipe.
0:50
I've taken 1/2 KG of chicken breast here.
Chicken Marination
0:53
Let's see how to cut this first.
0:55
Take the chicken breast like this.
0:57
Hold the knife like this, slanting it.
1:02
And then cut it into thin slices.
1:05
You can see that I've cut it into thin slices.
1:07
In the same way, cut it like this.
1:10
Cut it into thin slices like this.
1:12
So that when we cook the chicken,
1:14
it cooks quickly and becomes a juicy, tender, soft chicken.
1:18
You can see how I'm cutting the slices.
1:21
Cut all the chicken into slices in the same way.
1:25
Once you've cut the chicken like this,
1:27
transfer it to a big bowl.
1:29
And we have to marinate these as well.
1:32
For marination, first of all, salt to taste.
1:34
1 teaspoon vinegar.
1:36
1-1.5 tablespoon ginger, garlic and green chilli paste.
1:40
GGG paste.
1:41
Along with that, 1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder.
1:44
Mix all these things well with clean hands.
1:47
And apply this marinade on the chicken.
1:50
You can see that I've mixed all the ingredients.
1:53
Until we process the rest,
1:55
let the chicken marinate like this.
1:57
So our chicken is marinated.
1:59
It's a very basic marination.
2:02
And when you marinate the chicken,
2:04
right now, you can marinate it for 15-20 minutes or 1/2 an hour.
2:08
If you're doing it for a longer time,
2:10
then keep it in the fridge.
2:11
If you do it for a longer time,
2:13
the chicken becomes more tender.
2:15
We've sliced the chicken so thinly
2:18
that it will cook quickly and become a soft, juicy, tender chicken.
2:21
So now, I'm leaving it to marinate on the side.
2:23
Until then, we have to make a paste of Kashmiri chillies.
2:26
Let's see how to make that.
Red Chilli Paste
2:28
You can see that I've taken 15 Kashmiri red chillies.
2:31
I've cut them in the middle,
2:33
so that the seeds come out on their own.
2:35
After that, I've soaked them in hot water.
2:38
Soak them for 30-60 minutes.
2:41
The chillies will swell up like this.
2:43
Then you can make their paste.
2:45
Add the soaked Kashmiri chillies to a mixer grinding jar.
2:49
Add a little water and make a fine paste.
2:53
I'm grinding it in my BlendLab Pro 2.0.
2:55
It will grind the chillies in just a few seconds.
3:00

3:06
You can see that our bright red Kashmiri chilli paste is ready.
3:11
It's beautiful.
3:12
This paste will be the base of our Chicken Tawa Fry.
3:17
We'll also add a lot of garlic.
3:19
Once you've made the paste,
3:21
let's see how to cook the chicken on the Tawa.
3:23
It's a very simple method.
Cooking Process
3:24
I've taken an open Tawa.
3:27
Since it's a Tawa Fry, you have to cook it on the tawa or pan.
3:30
Add 2-3 tablespoons of oil to it.
3:32
Once the oil is hot,
3:34
add a lot of chopped garlic to it.
3:36
Take 3-4 tablespoons of chopped garlic.
3:40
Add the chilli paste that we made earlier.
3:44
Stir it a little.
3:46
Keep the garlic open.
3:48
Since it's a Garlic Fry, the flavour of the garlic should come out well.
3:51
Once you have stir it,
3:53
I've taken 1/3 cup of curd.
3:55
Whisk the curd well.
3:57
Whisk it well before adding it.
3:58
Otherwise, the curd will form lumps.
4:01
Add the curd.
4:02
Add salt to taste.
4:05
Add 1/2 teaspoon of Garam Masala.
4:07
Add 1 teaspoon of red chilli powder.
4:10
Kashmiri chillies are not spicy.
4:12
So, the spiciness will come from here.
4:14
Now, you have to stir everything well.
4:18
Cook it until the oil separates from the masala.
4:22
While cooking, if you feel that the masala is getting dry,
4:27
you can add hot water to it.
4:29
And you can cook it further.
4:31
Add hot water once or twice.
4:33
Cook it well.
4:35
If you cook the chillies, the flavours will come out.
4:38
Kashmiri chillies are a little sweet.
4:41
They also give a beautiful flavour after cooking.
4:44
Cook it well.
4:45
You'll enjoy eating this chicken.
4:48
You can see that after cooking it for 7-8 minutes,
4:52
the consistency of the masala has improved.
4:54
The masala already looks mind-blowing.
4:58
Once the masala is ready,
5:00
to round the flavours,
5:02
add a pinch of sugar.
5:04
And I'm adding a little hot water to adjust the consistency of the masala.
5:09
You can see that the masala should look like this.
5:12
Once the masala is ready,
5:14
it's time to add the marinated chicken to it.
5:18
Arrange the marinated chicken in a layer like this.
5:22
You can see how I'm arranging it.
5:26
Add the marinated chicken to the pan like this.
5:30
And let the chicken cook on a medium-high flame.
5:32
You have to let the chicken cook on one side.
5:35
You can let it cook for 2-4 minutes.
5:38
Or the edges of the chicken will start turning white.
5:42
You'll see that it's cooked on one side.
5:44
At this stage, you have to flip it.
5:47
Flip it like this.
5:48
You can see that the masala is covering the chicken nicely.
5:54
The chicken looks beautiful.
5:56
Once you flip all the chicken,
5:58
you have to cook it on the other side as well on a medium-high flame.
6:02
And you have to cook the chicken by flipping it once or twice.
6:07
Until the masala covers the chicken nicely.
6:11
The masala will slightly touch the pan.
6:14
The masala will get charred.
6:15
And you'll get beautiful flavours.
6:17
The texture and consistency of the masala will be mind-blowing.
6:23
You can see that I've cooked it by flipping it 2-3 times.
6:27
And the chicken looks beautiful.
6:29
And it has reached the perfect consistency and texture.
6:33
You just have to give it a finishing touch.
6:35
You have to add it from the top.
6:37
Chop the stem of the coriander and add it.
6:40
It gives a lot of freshness and crunch when you eat the chicken.
6:43
You have to add fresh chopped coriander on top.
6:46
And lastly, there's an optional thing.
6:48
Add small pieces of butter.
6:51
Butter with garlic and chilli is a beautiful combination.
6:55
Add some butter.
6:57
And look at our Chilli Garlic Tawa Chicken.
7:01
And it's ready.
7:03
Let's plate it, YFL style.

8:53
And Kashmiri red chillies are not spicy.
8:55
So those who think it's crazy spicy.
8:58
It's not like that.
8:59
If you want to make it spicy,
9:00
you have to add green chillies and red chillies.
