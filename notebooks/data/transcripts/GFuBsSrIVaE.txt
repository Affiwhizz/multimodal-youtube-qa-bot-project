About Coq au Vin
1:09
coco van is a synonymous with french
1:11
cooking
1:12
as hamburgers are with american cooking
1:15
i mean it's the
1:16
just the dish you're going to find all
1:17
over france everywhere
1:19
everybody loves it my mom used to make
1:21
this all the time for me when i was a
1:23
little kid
1:24
my mom worked two jobs as a nurse and
1:26
she didn't have a lot of time to be at
1:28
home
1:28
spending hours cooking so she would make
1:30
a batch of coco van
1:32
on her weekend and then we could eat it
1:34
whenever we wanted to during the week in
1:36
fact it's a dish that only gets better
1:38
with age
1:40
much like myself so coco van for the
1:43
very few of you
1:44
that you have never heard of it or don't
1:46
remember
1:48
is chicken that's braised slowly
1:51
in a red wine rich rich red wine sauce
1:55
you have pieces of bacon or lardon
1:58
there you have little pearl onions
2:01
button mushrooms super delicious great
2:04
served over
2:05
mashed potatoes or roast potatoes
2:08
my favorite would be like making almost
2:10
like a macaroni and cheese gratin
2:13
or even just simple butter noodles
2:14
something starchy that's going to really
2:16
soak up all those delicious juices
2:19
so let's get cracking
Step 1 Cut Chicken
2:23
[Music]
2:27
so the very first step we gotta do is to
2:30
cut our chicken into eight equal pieces
2:33
so you're gonna have your legs you're
2:35
going to have your thighs
2:36
your two chicken well here's the thigh
2:39
you're gonna have your
2:40
drumstick your breast
2:44
and then we'll also have our wings and
2:47
then we're gonna
2:48
put it in a pot and i did this already
2:50
because this this is going to marinade
2:52
overnight
2:53
for it to be delicious so you're going
2:55
to take your chicken
2:56
you're going to put it in a pot or a pan
2:59
you're going to cover it with a bottle
3:01
of red wine
3:02
and then i put in some chopped up
3:05
celery carrots and onion and we're just
3:08
gonna let this marinade covered in your
3:10
fridge
3:10
overnight at least 24 hours because if
3:14
you notice how purpley
3:17
how purpley this chicken is
3:20
it's just you know soaked up all those
3:22
delicious juices
3:24
so that is the first step
Step 2 Onions
3:32
step two we're gonna take about 16 or 20
3:36
pearl onions and put them in a pot along
3:40
with one quart of homemade chicken stock
3:43
and if you click in the links down below
3:46
i'll i'll
3:46
put a link to how to make homemade
3:48
chicken stock so we're just going to
3:49
pour that in a pot
3:52
and we're just bring this to a simmer
3:54
and we're going to simmer it
3:56
until the onions are soft you can take a
3:59
knife
4:00
and easily pierce it it's about 20
4:02
minutes
4:04
i'm using chipolini onions and what
4:06
you're just looking for is small onions
4:08
i like chipolini's because they're
4:09
really sweet
4:11
most stores carry these if you can't
4:13
find
4:14
fresh chipolini onions you could either
4:17
dice a regular
4:18
onion you can also go to the frozen
4:20
section and usually find peeled
4:23
pearl onions there especially around
4:24
thanksgiving time
4:26
so anyways we're going to bring this to
4:27
a boil let this simmer for about 20
4:30
minutes or so until the onions are soft
4:33
that is step two
Step 3 Bacon
4:34
[Music]
4:39
step three we're gonna take our slab
4:42
bacon you need about a quarter pound
4:44
four ounces and i like big hunks of
4:48
bacon i don't know there's something
4:49
about getting a big
4:50
chewy fatty crunchy yummy bit of love
4:54
like in each bite you can cut it a
4:57
little smaller if you like but what i
4:58
like at the end of the day is just nice
5:00
big size cubes like this
5:02
and we're just going to drop them in our
5:04
pan
5:04
[Music]
5:05
and we're going to cook these slowly
5:10
until they are nice and brown
5:13
crispy and the fat has run out of them
5:18
[Music]
5:23
is there anything sexier than bacon
5:24
cooking no
5:30
just you know be sure to cook your bacon
5:33
over lower heat because we're looking
5:35
for all the fat to come out and it's get
5:37
crispy
5:38
and not to burn
Step 4 Mushrooms
5:40
[Music]
5:44
step four we're going to take our button
5:47
mushrooms
5:48
and we're just going to clean them up so
5:49
if you have a brush that works really
5:51
great you could take a cloth and wipe
5:53
off the dirt or last result which i
5:58
don't recommend you could dip these into
6:00
water and just rinse them really quick
6:01
the problem is they soak up a lot of
6:03
water and you're adding more water to
6:05
your dish which is not what you want to
6:06
do
6:07
and you should also trim the bottom of
6:09
the mushroom stems right here
6:11
you can just take a paring knife and
6:14
just
6:15
cut like that just till it's nice and
6:18
beautiful
6:21
like that be sure to save these for when
6:24
you make some chicken stock
6:27
if your mushroom is too big like this
6:29
guy right here
6:32
you could cut it in half like that or
6:34
even quarter it if you prefer it doesn't
6:37
really matter whatever works for you
6:39
also you know traditionally this is made
6:41
with button mushrooms
6:43
you could also use cremini mushrooms
6:46
or if you want to make it a little bit
6:47
fancier you can make this with morel
6:49
mushrooms
6:51
oh and by the way stay to the very end
6:53
of the video
6:54
because i'm going to teach you two
6:57
different
6:57
versions of coco van that you've never
7:00
seen before so stick to the very end of
7:02
the video if you want to catch that
7:04
all right next step when your bacon is
7:07
cooked and look how beautiful this
7:09
is it's just nice golden brown we got a
7:12
lot of fat in there
7:13
it's going to be perfect we're gonna
7:16
take our
7:17
bacon put in the strainer here
7:22
and you wanna save all this fat because
7:24
this one we're gonna be browning our
7:25
chicken
7:26
in this what we're gonna be browning our
7:28
mushrooms
7:29
so strain these guys off
7:32
and then we're going to take our cleaned
7:34
mushrooms and we're just going to drop
7:36
it in the pan
7:37
[Music]
7:39
and saute it in the meantime you can put
7:41
the bacon onto
7:45
this paper towel to absorb any extra fat
7:49
and right now you're probably thinking
7:50
like why is he cooking all the garnishes
7:53
separately
7:54
when you make cook event you always cook
7:57
half cook
7:58
all your garnishes and then you're going
8:00
to add it about halfway through the
8:01
cooking process
8:03
because traditionally coco van was made
8:05
with
8:06
older chickens and sometimes they took
8:08
hours to stew
8:10
you know nowadays most chickens you find
8:12
in a grocery store the cocoa van will
8:14
cook in about one hour
8:16
um and actually today i am using
8:20
um bluefoot chickens that are grown here
8:23
in washington
8:24
state so these are the same the famous
8:27
come from the same
8:28
lineage as the famous poulet de brest or
8:31
the blue footed chickens you see in
8:32
burgundy france
8:34
these are just the most delicious
8:37
chickens but
8:38
you know feel free to use whatever you
8:41
find in your grocery store
8:45
all right and with the mushrooms all
8:47
we're doing is looking just to
8:49
get them a little bit brown just just
8:51
okay
8:54
[Music]
9:00
[Music]
9:03
look at that so perfect
9:07
all right let's check on our mushrooms
9:12
oh look at that perfect
9:16
all right so we're just going to spray
9:18
these guys real quick
9:20
you can put your mushrooms in the same
9:22
plate
9:23
as your bacon just keep that ready and
9:26
you know when the pearl onions are done
9:28
we're going to add them to the plate as
9:30
well
9:31
so pour back any of the fat
Step 5 Brown Chicken
9:41
now it's time to brown our chicken
9:45
and so we're going to strain the
9:46
marinade so what we're looking to do is
9:49
keep the
9:50
liquid and keep the chicken pieces
9:54
so when you pull the chicken out of the
9:56
marinade you're going to want to pull
9:57
off any bits of vegetable
9:59
that are stuck to it just put those
10:02
right in the strainer
10:05
all right
10:10
we're going to keep our marinade right
10:11
there then let's just lay out all our
10:14
chicken pieces here
10:21
all right we got our chicken pieces laid
10:23
out in front of us
10:25
and let's just season it up and i like
10:26
to use black pepper
10:30
just keep it really simple black pepper
10:34
some salt and that's about it
10:40
all right next let's brown our chicken
10:43
so just after we've seasoned the chicken
10:45
we're gonna put it
10:47
in our bacon fat skin side down
10:50
get it nice and brown on all sides
10:54
and if your pan's not too big you really
10:56
don't want to put too much in because
10:58
you're going to lower the temperature of
10:59
the
11:00
fat and then you're going to stew the
11:02
chicken rather than
11:04
give it a nice browning
11:08
so you might want to do it in fact
11:14
while our chicken is browning let's
11:15
check our pearl onions
11:18
all right so like i said you just want
11:20
to take a paring knife
11:22
and stick it into your onion and it
11:24
should go into the onion
11:25
really easily when you get to that point
11:29
just pull all your onions out
11:32
put them on your plate with your other
11:35
garnishes
11:36
and be sure to save this stock because
11:38
we're going to be adding it to the
11:41
to the red wine to break the chicken in
11:46
be sure and flip the chicken while
11:48
you're cooking it so it browns on both
11:54
sides
11:56
oh my god it smells so incredibly good
11:59
in the house i mean look at this
12:01
beautiful beautiful chicken so as soon
12:04
as it's nicely brown
12:08
we're gonna drop it into our into a
12:11
dutch oven
12:12
where we're going to finish the cooking
12:15
you could do this all in one pan but i
12:17
think you're going to see why i like to
12:19
do it in here
12:24
all right and look in this pan it's
12:25
glistening it's still got some of that
12:27
beautiful
12:28
fat in there we're going to add about a
12:30
spoonful
12:31
of flour and what we're doing is we're
12:35
just basically making a roux and this is
12:37
going to give the
12:38
the cook of that like beautiful body
12:41
when you're cooking it just rub it in
12:44
there
12:45
rub it in mix it in with all the fat
12:51
and then right now i still have the heat
12:52
off um which is fine
12:55
pens plenty hot enough still we're gonna
12:58
add about
12:59
a quarter cup or so of cognac you could
13:02
use brandy you don't have to use
13:04
any of this and what we're trying to do
13:07
is just loosen up these
13:09
brown little bits in this pan
13:12
and i'm like sitting here with the
13:14
ruling
13:15
ah it's the best thing in the world then
13:18
we're gonna add our marinade
13:23
at this point you can turn your pen back
13:25
on again
13:27
and we're just gonna give this all a
13:28
good stir
13:31
and you know just scrape to loosen up
13:32
any of the little bits stuck to the
13:34
bottom of the pan
13:37
[Music]
13:45
and then we're also going to add the
13:46
chicken stock that we cooked the onions
13:48
in
13:53
and i know right now this doesn't look
13:55
like a lot to you
13:57
it just kind of looks like a blah sauce
14:00
but i'm gonna promise you when we're all
14:02
done with this it's gonna be incredible
14:05
okay and if you have a whisk grab a
14:06
whisk
14:08
give it a good stir we're trying to just
14:10
break up any chunks of the roux that we
14:12
made in there
14:14
and when you feel like you've scraped
14:16
the pan down enough
14:18
um we're gonna put a strainer over our
14:21
dutch oven
14:22
and we're just gonna take all of this
14:24
liquid here
14:26
and pour it through the strainer
14:33
so all these little bits right here
14:36
don't end up in your beautiful sausage
14:41
all right to this we're gonna add a bay
14:44
leaf
14:45
a big bunch of thyme and then we're just
14:48
gonna let this braise
14:49
slowly now if you're cooking
14:52
just as standard chicken you're gonna
14:54
find in most american grocery stores
14:57
i would cook it about half an hour
14:58
before you add your garnish
15:01
since we are using a older hen
15:05
and it's also a blue foot chicken which
15:07
tends to be a little bit
15:09
needs a little bit longer cooking time
15:11
i'm gonna check this in about 45 minutes
15:14
i'll be back see you then
15:19
all right welcome back this is cooked
Step 6 Serve
15:22
now for about an hour about halfway
15:24
through i added the onions the
15:26
bacon and the mushrooms let's check it
15:28
out see how it looks
15:34
oh my god i i swear i'm drooling this is
15:38
smells
15:38
so freaking delicious i cannot wait to
15:41
eat this
15:42
let's check it out
15:49
all right so the chicken is looking
15:52
great
15:52
super tender
15:55
the garnishes are still maintaining
15:58
their shape
16:00
you know that's the thing if you put
16:02
everything in too soon the
16:04
the mushrooms and stuff might break down
16:05
and fall apart let's give this
16:08
juice a little bit of a taste
16:15
tastes so good so the only thing i'd say
16:17
now is
16:18
you know the broth is a little bit thin
16:20
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
16:21
take everything out
16:23
and reduce this by 50 that's going to
16:25
take down 10 15 minutes something like
16:27
that
16:29
and then the sauce will be ready so
16:31
let's reduce it
16:33
wow is the cocoa vest smelling so good
16:37
you know and look at this sauce i've
16:39
cooked it down
16:40
so much i don't know if you can see that
16:44
it's just really rich and
16:48
um you just have the taste of um
16:52
the red wine the chicken that's slowly
16:54
cooked in there the mushrooms
16:57
with the bacon and so for serving
17:04
i would just take a piece make sure you
17:06
get some of the accompaniments
17:10
important to get a bunch of the sauce
17:21
get that there a little bit of parsley
17:26
and then let's finish it with just a
17:28
little bit of pasta that i cooked
17:30
just a touch of cream and just a little
17:34
bit of cheese
17:35
almost like a gratin
17:39
and these kind of noodles just really
17:41
work well they soak it up
17:43
mashed potatoes are perfect roast
17:45
potatoes
17:48
you know just anything kind of rich
17:52
all right let's give this a try
18:03
[Music]
18:10
wow is that delicious this is one of my
18:14
favorite dishes i mean
18:16
coco van is one of the iconic french
18:19
dishes of classical cuisine
18:22
you'll find this as much in restaurants

18:57
if you stayed to the very end i had a
18:59
surprise for you
19:00
so coco van is one of those great
19:02
foundational dishes
19:04
and there's three i know i told you two
19:06
before but there's three variations you
19:08
should know about so the first one
19:11
is o riesling so instead of red
19:15
wine you take a nice
19:16
white riesling and you finish the sauce
19:19
with
19:20
about a half a cup of cream so follow
19:22
the exact same recipe
19:24
substitute the riesling for the red wine
19:27
and then add a half cup of cream or
19:29
creme fraiche at the very end
19:31
it's delicious you're gonna love that
19:34
it's a wonderful variation
19:36
two more variations for you uh the

french also make uh
19:40
pouleo bier so pick your favorite beer
19:44
whatsoever
19:45
a nice delicious ipa uh
19:48
whatever you like and substitute that
19:51
for
19:52
the red wine so for your beer drinkers
19:54
that's your
19:55
your braised chicken dish and then the
19:57
very last you know right now it's fall
20:00
