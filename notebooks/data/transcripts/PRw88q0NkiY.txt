hello my friends namashkar and welcome  to Curries with Bumbi today I will show  
0:04
you how to make chickpea butter masala it is a  quick recipe but it is very very delicious and  
0:10
it tastes just like the ones that you get at  restaurants we will first do the blender work  
0:15
in your blender jar add some Tomatoes garlic  and ginger and make a smooth puree out of it
0:30
in a pot add about a tbsp of oil and 2 tbsp  of butter as soon as the butter melts add a  
0:37
teaspoon of cumin seeds that is jira then add  finely chopped onions make sure you chop your  
0:43
onions very fine in that way the onions will  Brown up faster at the same time they will  
0:49
blend in well into the gravy at the end I just  don't like to see pieces of onion swimming here  
0:55
and there in the gravy and staring at me I  added a fourth of a teaspoon of salt to the  
1:00
onions to help them soften up faster now you do  not want the onions to turn too deep and dark  
1:05
brown in color a light brown color is what we  are aiming for see how beautiful the onions are  
1:11
looking now at this point I like adding about  half a tablespoon of thick tomato paste tomato  
1:18
paste is optional but the tomato is available now  at tasteless so I prefer adding the concentrated  
1:25
tomato paste it not only brings in a nice orange  color to the dish but it also gives a nice flavor  
1:31
after adding the tomato paste fry it on medium low  heat for a minute and then it is spice time half a  
1:38
teaspoon of turmeric powder a heaped teaspoon  of kashmiri red chili powder 2 tsp of ground  
1:44
coriander that is dhania powder and a teaspoon of  ground cumin that is jeera powder fry the spice  
1:51
powders on low heat just for a few seconds and  then add the Blended tomato ginger and garlic
2:00
give a stir and then cover it on medium heat for 5
2:03
[Music] minutes after 5 minutes again give  a stir and then cover it partially on medium  
2:14
heat you want everything to thicken  up more okay so I have used canned  
2:19
chickpeas but you can also use dry chickpeas  in that case soak it overnight and cook them  
2:25
till they are tender since I'm using canned  chickpeas I drained all the liquid from the  
2:30
can and rinse the chickpeas under tap water  now from this I will save a third of a cup  
2:35
of chickpeas and I will tell you why a little  later okay the tomato has thickened up quite a
2:42
bit now I add about 2 tsp of salt and a  teaspoon of sugar to balance the flavors  
2:52
then a teaspoon of garam masala powder  goes in and this is my homemade garam  
2:57
masala powder I will leave the link to  that video in the description box finally  
3:02
a teaspoon of dried fenugreek leaves that  is kasoori methi crush it a little and add
3:07
it then the chickpeas tumble down stir them very  
3:14
well so that they get well  coated and fried with that
3:17
Masala next add about a cup of hot
3:24
water now remember that third of a cup of  of chickpeas that we had saved earlier pour  
3:32
that into your blender jar along with  half a cup of water and puree it to a  
3:36
smooth paste then add this chickpea paste  into the gravy what this will do is that  
3:45
it will bring in a thickness to the gravy  I added a fourth of a teaspoon of black  
3:51
pepper powder next cover on low heat for  15 minutes in between give a stir and cover
4:00
again 15 minutes done and  see how gorgeous the curry is
4:10
looking do a taste test at this point and  adjust the seasonings I felt the need to  
4:19
add a little more of sugar as it was tasting  a bit sour then chopped coriander leaves go  
4:25
in and more goodness on the way that is a  third of a cup of heavy cream cream if you  
4:30
are allergic to dairy or if you are following a  vegan diet you can add coconut cream or coconut
4:36
milk cover it again on low heat for 5 more  minutes after 5 minutes you're almost done  
4:48
but there is still another step that I would  love to do I plated it out garnished it with  
4:54
some chopped coriander leaves drizzle some  cream on top then heat a small pan over low  
5:02
heat I added a tablespoon of butter because  it is butter chickpea masala my friends and  
5:08
just a drop of oil so that the butter doesn't  burn once the butter starts melting switch off  
5:13
the heat and add a teaspoon of sweet paprika to  the melted butter my friends please remember to  
5:19
switch off the heat when adding the paprika to  the melted butter or else it will burn you can  
5:24
also use Kashmir chili powder instead of paprika  then drizzle this buttery p paprika goodness over  
5:30
the chickpeas now this my friends tastes just  like the one served at restaurants and you will  
5:37
love it serve it with naan or any flatbread of  your choice please give me a thumbs up if you've
