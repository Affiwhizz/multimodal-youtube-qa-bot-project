0:33
All right, goodies. Let's cook this mean
0:37
wicked pork shouldola in the kitchen
0:39
fast, easy, and simple. Right. All
0:41
right. So, the first thing that I do
0:43
before I always start to season up any
0:46
kind of thing when I cook in my kitchen
0:47
is wash the meat thoroughly. Now, for
0:50
me, I use I like a combination of three
0:53
things. salt, lemon juice, and vinegar.
0:55
Them tree things, Juliana, if you guys
0:58
have been following me for a while, you
1:00
guys know that I love to use vinegar to
1:02
clean up my things, right? Salt, lemon
1:04
juice, and vinegar is what I use to wash
1:06
my meat now. You want to be sure though
1:09
to get the excess of water that might
1:11
have been left over when you are done
1:14
with that step of washing your meat.
1:17
Chicken, beef, pork. Listen, wash your
1:19
meat, okay? Wash your meat. Clean up
1:21
your meat before you start cooking.
1:23
Okay? And make sure that you get all the
1:25
water off. Now, some of you guys may be
1:27
saying, "Why your pot dry?" You want to
1:29
be sure that the seasons cling to your
1:31
meat before you start adding the
1:33
seasoning so the thing tastes nice. Now,
1:36
after I have done that and I'm satisfied
1:38
of the amount of water that I take off,
1:40
before I start to put the seasonings on
1:43
for this recipe, I'm going to add some
1:45
oil. Any regular shar in your kitchen,
1:48
you go ahead and use that. Okay? Now,
1:50
don't talk about my nails in the
1:51
comments because it not make no sense.
1:53
So, skip the nail and move on to the
1:54
recipe cuz I cook for me and my family.
1:57
Okay? So, you want to go ahead and add
2:00
the oil on both sides of your meat just
2:03
like so. Just like so. If you have any
2:06
other way you want to rub it, you rub
2:07
it. But I rub my one. Okay. Nice and
2:10
gentle. All right. So, I did go ahead
2:11
and wash my hands of course before I
2:13
start touching my seasoning bottles.
2:15
Now, I'm going to add some black pepper.
2:18
If you guys notice, I didn't start off
2:20
with any salt because I'm not adding any
2:22
salt to this meat. All right, so I added
2:24
black pepper, onion powder. I'm adding
2:27
also some garlic powder. If you want to
2:29
add salt to your one going to go ahead
2:30
and add it. Okay, I'm adding some kind
2:32
of a meat season here because we are
2:34
cooking pork, right? So, I went ahead
2:36
and added this one. I love this one.
2:37
This is from Ourus. It tastes really,
2:40
really good. And again, for those of you
2:41
that have been following me for a while,
2:43
you'll know how I feel about or
2:44
seasoning. I'm adding some allpurpose
2:47
seasoning here. Rous brand. Use whatever
2:48
you have. But add some curry powder.
2:51
Right. So rice brand also love it. All
2:54
right. So add just a little bit there
2:56
and add some paprika. Okay. Listen
2:58
y'all. Make sure not follow the steps.
3:00
Okay. Make sure not follow the steps.
3:02
Then I went ahead and add some onion.
3:04
Any regular shea kind of onion you have.
3:07
Go ahead and just drizzle a little bit
3:09
on the meat. Just like so. All right.
3:12
And then you just gently gently
3:15
just smooth it on up in there. Okay. On
3:18
on all on that. Just smooth it on up in
3:20
there. Good. Make sure the season all
3:22
nice and pat dry everything just like
3:24
so. All right. When you're done with
3:26
that, you want to be sure that you
3:27
season the other side of the meat
3:28
because you don't want the thing taste
3:30
lopsided, right? So you flip it on the
3:32
side and you go you repeat the same
3:35
thing that you did to the step number
3:37
one. Same thing. Nothing different. Same
3:40
thing. black pepper, onion powder,
3:43
garlic powder, um oaria seasonings of
3:46
all sorts that I like. You could always
3:48
substitute out the seasoning of your
3:50
choice. If you don't have orcheras, use
3:53
um whatever Maggi, anything you have in
3:56
your kitchen, you go ahead and use it.
3:57
Make your kitchen happy because why a
3:59
your kitchen. Okay, so I went ahead and
4:02
did all of that on both sides. Looks
4:05
pretty much like that. Well, well, well,
4:08
well seasoned really thoroughly. And I
4:10
love that. Then I wash my hands, of
4:13
course. Okay. Girl, wash her hand. All
4:15
right. So, nobody come about wash and
4:17
business. Girl, wash her hand and round
4:18
the clock. Okay. All right. So, when I'm
4:21
done with that, I'm going to go ahead
4:23
and cover it up with some plastic wrap.
4:25
Now, if you don't want to cook this same
4:26
time, I'm going to be cooking this right
4:28
away. I'm going to let it sit for about
4:30
30 minutes. You could always put it in
4:31
your refrigerator overnight, but me not
4:33
time for them something there. Not have
4:35
time for waste. So me cover up mine for
4:37
30 minutes. I'm going go and marinate it
4:39
for 30 minutes. That's all I'mma have
4:41
for 30 minutes. It's sitting and it's
4:43
chilling just like that at room
4:45
temperature. While it's sitting for that
4:47
30 minutes, I'm going going to go in
4:49
with some allpurpose flour. I added a
4:51
little bit of black pepper, onion
4:52
powder, and a little bit of garlic
4:55
powder. And again, if you guys notice, I
4:56
didn't add any salt because go girl, I
4:58
cut down on salt, right? Did add some of
5:00
that oerio seasoning to it and some
5:02
dried parsley flakes. And that's all
5:04
that I had here. Gave it a good mix like
5:08
so. Make sure so everything is nicely
5:10
distributed in an allpurpose flour. Do
5:12
not use self-resing flour, wheat flour,
5:15
or allpurpose flour. And it should look
5:18
a little something like that. Okay? Like
5:20
that. Now, while that is chilling out,
5:22
we're going to go ahead and get the oil
5:23
ready. Any regular shear aisle that you
5:25
have, you go ahead and start off. But
5:27
you want to be sure that you add some
5:29
kind of butter into that oil. For me,
5:32
I'm using a regular shea butter. Okay. I
5:34
can't believe it's not butter. That's
5:35
what I added to it. All right. So, I'm
5:37
adding some chopped garlic here. You
5:39
could use fresh one if that's what you
5:40
have. Combine all of these. You want to
5:43
be sure that you turn the fire down a
5:44
little bit, okay? Because mine was a
5:46
little bit acting up. Okay? My one was a
5:48
little bit too high, but the things
5:50
still turn out nice, but you want to be
5:52
sure that your stove is top is at a
5:53
medium heat. Now, while that is going,
5:56
now it's the time to dip the meat, the
5:59
pork shoulder in the flour mixer. Now,
6:01
be sure that you don't overdo it though
6:04
as if you was frying chicken because you
6:06
not fry escoish chicken. Okay? And a
6:08
Escobish chicken fry. You just coating
6:11
the meat in the flour just like so. Very
6:14
gently.
6:16
And then you shake off the excess flour.
6:19
All right. Just like so. All right. Just
6:21
shake it all off, baby. Just shake it
6:23
off. And then you're going to put it
6:26
into the pot the pot and make it do it
6:30
thing. Okay. Again, goody, you are not
6:32
frying chicken. Okay. You're not fried
6:34
chicken at all. We're just looking for
6:37
color here. Okay. So, we go ahead and
6:39
add the meat in. All right. My pot take
6:42
two at a time. I have three pieces.
6:44
After about I say 6 minutes. I went
6:46
ahead and turn it because I'm just
6:49
looking for color here. So, I turn it on
6:51
the other side and let it do its thing
6:53
for 6 minutes. So, 6 minutes on each
6:56
side. Just know that the meat is not
6:59
cooked thoroughly for in in 12 minutes.
7:02
It take more time to cook. But all
7:04
you're looking for right here is color.
7:06
As you could see, it's not cooked yet.
7:07
Okay, that is exactly what you need. Um
7:10
don't worry about um anything in the pot
7:12
that look dark. That is just the garlic
7:14
or whatever. But still, you want to turn
7:16
on your fire because like I said, I
7:18
almost you know what I'm saying? Mess up
7:20
me thing with the little fire too high.
7:22
So make sure you have your fire pan a
7:24
medium heat. All right. So, still turn
7:26
out nice, right? Still looking pretty.
7:28
Okay. Still looking pretty. All right.
7:30
So, when I'm done, I'm going to go ahead
7:31
and put that aside. Put all the meat
7:34
aside. And again, a total of 12 minutes
7:38
total. 6 minutes on one side, six on on
7:40
the other side. And then you sit them
7:42
aside. And then I go and chill out and
7:44
wait. Now, while that's waiting, I it's
7:46
time that I prep my onions. Now, for
7:49
this recipe, it's all about if you love
7:52
lots of onions. In my home, love onion.
7:56
I love me some onions, but I don't like
7:58
raw onions. That makes sense. I like
8:00
cooked onions. So, I went ahead and
8:03
washed my pot. And I did tell you guys
8:04
that I was using I can't believe it's
8:06
not butter. Just go ahead and use
8:08
whatever kind of butter that you have in
8:10
your kitchen. It's going to do the job.
8:12
Okay. I can't believe it's not butter
8:14
over here. Okay. So, I went ahead and
8:15
added my butter to it. added those
8:17
beautiful onions to it. We are sautéing
8:20
the onions is what we are doing. Okay,
8:22
we not going they doing no extra with
8:25
the with the onions. We just sautéing
8:26
the onions. So now that the onions is
8:29
well looking good and smelling amazing
8:31
with the butter and the garlic and all
8:34
that other good stuff, it's time to give
8:36
it some flavor. So I'm just going to
8:38
gently season just by adding some black
8:40
pepper and a little bit of dried pepper
8:42
flakes. No salt. That is it. That's all
8:45
that I'm adding because why? My meat
8:47
seasoned to the core. Okay. All right.
8:50
So, when it looks pretty much like that
8:52
and again, your fire should be at a
8:53
medium heat, not more than that. I'm
8:57
going to add some vinegar. I'm using
8:58
apple cider because I love love vinegar.
9:02
If you have been following me for years,
9:04
my good my old time goodies and don't
9:06
know Julian, I love our some vinegar.
9:08
Okay. So now I, as you could see, I kind
9:10
of moved the onions out the way because
9:12
I want to make sure that the onions go
9:14
on top of the meat when I put them in
9:16
the pot. So you want to kind of shift
9:18
the onions out the way and make sure
9:20
that you get those onions on top of your
9:24
meat and not underneath the meat. Okay?
9:27
Get them on top of the meat goodie. All
9:28
right? Just like I'm doing. Just like
9:30
this. Okay? Put it on top of that meat.
9:33
And trust me, it's going to be doing
9:35
some things on your meat. It's going to
9:38
have a wicked flavor when you do that.
9:40
So, now that it's looking good like
9:42
that, you want to add a little bit of
9:43
water. Do not throw it on top of the
9:45
meat. Put it around the perimeter,
9:47
around the ends of the pot, just like
9:49
so. Not too much. Turn your stove down
9:52
to low to medium heat. You want this
9:54
thing to steam and not cook fast because
9:58
it does cook very fast. That is one
10:01
thing that I like about pork shouldola.
10:03
It's very tender. Okay. You cover it up.
10:06
I'll say maybe 20 minutes, 25 minutes,
10:08
30 minutes at the most. And when you
10:10
come back, baby, I write a cert. You are
10:12
all done. This thing is good with rice
10:14
and peas, mashed potatoes, spaghettis,
10:18
some veggies, whatever you want. This is
10:20
it right here. But do me a favor. Tell
10:24
the man up the street. Tell the girl the
10:25
road. Bring them. Come and send them.
10:26
Come cuz I'm waiting. When you get done
10:29
doing all of that, tell me where you
10:31
want to see me cook next in on the
10:32
kitchen. And remember, as always, from
10:34
my kitchen to your kitchen, enjoy.
