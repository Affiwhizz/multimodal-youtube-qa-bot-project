hey everyone alia here from sirian eats
0:03
today's recipe is actually one of the
0:05
top viewed recipes on my channel so i
0:07
remade a new video for you guys
0:10
it's called chakriel chakri is a meat
0:13
cooked in a yogurt sauce we're gonna
0:15
start out with two pounds of lamb you
0:17
can use leg of lamb and then just chop
0:20
it up into big chunks
0:22
or if you don't like lamb you can also
0:24
do it with uh stew meat uh beef
0:27
i'm gonna go ahead and wash them put
0:29
them in my instant pot
0:31
and we're going to let the water boil
0:33
and we're going to take that foam off
0:35
as soon as it starts boiling just like
0:36
this we're going to try to remove as
0:38
much foam as we can if we don't remove
0:40
this foam the meat is going to have a
0:42
gamy taste which we don't want so try to
0:45
remove as much as you can as it boils
0:48
so to the meat i added about six to
0:50
eight cups of water really it doesn't
0:52
matter how much the water is because
0:53
we're not going to use it in our dish
0:56
to the water i am adding right now one
0:58
tablespoon of salt one tablespoon of
1:00
allspice one bay leaf four cloves and
1:03
two cups of diced onions
1:06
[Music]
1:09
give it a good stir and then we're gonna
1:11
put our pressure lid on and we're gonna
1:13
pressure cook this on meat mode
1:16
for 40 minutes
1:18
[Music]
1:19
so here i have some homemade yogurt i
1:22
actually have a video i will put the
1:24
link above you can click it to see how i
1:26
make homemade yogurt or if you want to
1:28
use store-bought you're going to need
1:29
about three 32-ounce containers or about
1:32
a hundred ounces of yogurt with a mesh
1:34
strainer on top of your pot we're gonna
1:36
go ahead and strain our yogurt so we
1:38
won't get any lumps
1:40
[Music]
1:54
now to our yogurt with no heat on yet
1:56
i'm adding one egg and we're gonna
1:58
strain it through our strainer as well
2:01
and make sure you scrape the bottom of
2:03
the strainer as well
2:05
so i'm gonna start with two teaspoons of
2:06
salt we can always add salt later when
2:09
we taste it when it's ready
2:11
and i am going to start my heat on
2:14
medium and i'm gonna add half a cup of
2:17
cornstarch we're gonna whisk that well
2:20
until everything is mixed together and
2:23
then we're gonna start cooking it
2:24
so you are gonna keep stirring your
2:26
yogurt until it starts thickening and
2:29
then i'm gonna go check on my meat
2:32
so my meat is ready nice and tender
2:35
we're gonna go ahead and strain it
2:37
reserve the broth for now because if our
2:39
yogurt does come out too thick we can
2:41
always thin it out with that broth
2:43
putting that broth in the yogurt gives
2:45
it a really good flavor
2:46
make sure you fish out the cloves and
2:48
the bay leaf
2:50
your yogurt starts thickening up to test
2:53
it we mark the back of the spoon and see
2:55
if it leaves a empty mark it means that
2:58
the yogurt is starting to thicken up and
3:00
then we can go ahead and add our meat
3:02
mixture and then wait for it to boil
3:06
after adding the meat mixture i'm going
3:08
to go ahead and let it cook for about
3:10
five minutes or until it starts boiling
3:13
then you can turn off the heat and serve
3:16
this is served with a delicious
3:18
vermicelli rice and it's served usually
3:20
at room temperature
3:23
top it off with some toasted pine nuts
3:25
and enjoy with some radishes
3:28
thank you for watching
