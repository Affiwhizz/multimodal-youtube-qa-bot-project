0:05
be making one of my favorite dish
0:08
a delicious pot of curried chicken this
0:11
pot is packed with flavors
0:14
absolutely tasty let us begin
0:20
[Music]
0:27
here i have a whole chicken that i'm
0:29
just gonna cut into pieces then i'm
0:31
gonna wash with the limes and you can
0:34
use any parts of a chicken you like
0:36
whether it be breast
0:37
or thigh it's really your choice
0:41
[Music]
0:47
oh that chicken is nice and clean it's
0:49
time to season add in some salt some
0:52
black pepper a bit of jerk seasoning yes
0:56
some all-purpose seasoning and my green
0:59
season blend then in with the star of
1:02
the show some curry powder then i'm just
1:05
going to mix that together
1:08
link on how to make my green season
1:10
blend will be down below in the
1:11
description box but it's basically a
1:14
blend of skeleton and thyme
1:17
garlic and onion and pimento peppers
1:21
[Music]
1:24
now that this chicken is perfectly
1:26
seasoned i'm just gonna cover and allow
1:29
to marinade for about
1:31
30 minutes
1:38
after about 20 minutes of marinating
1:40
because i really could not wait to a pot
1:43
over medium heat i'm just gonna add some
1:45
cooking oil along with some chopped
1:47
onions and garlic
1:49
also some curry powder and this term is
1:53
called burning the curry and i recommend
1:56
you do not skip out on this part just by
1:58
allowing the curry to slightly saute
2:01
with the onions and garlic before adding
2:04
in the chicken add volumes of flavor to
2:07
this meal
2:11
then in with this well seasoned curry
2:14
chicken now i'm just going to allow this
2:16
chicken to soak up all the flavors by
2:19
just mixing everything together
2:24
[Music]
2:26
when i tell you this chicken haven't
2:28
even started to cook and it is smelling
2:32
absolutely delicious you see the
2:34
fragrance from the slightly burnt curry
2:37
the garlic and the onion
2:39
yes man
2:41
gonna cover this under the lowest heat
2:44
for about five minutes
2:46
and after five minutes of simmering the
2:48
chicken has created its own juice
2:51
and the secret the top secret to a
2:54
delicious curry is allowing the meat to
2:57
cook in its own sauce just for a few
2:59
minutes before adding in any water
3:10
do not rush to pour any water just make
3:14
sure the heat is on medium to low and it
3:17
will create its own sauce
3:23
now i'm going to add some potatoes and
3:25
carrots which is totally optional some
3:28
skeleton thyme and some pimento peppers
3:30
for flavor then i'm just gonna cover
3:33
this
3:34
still under the lower seeds
3:36
still know what is added for another few
3:39
minutes
3:51
this chicken i've been cooking in its
3:53
own juices for majority of the cooking
3:55
time i want to tell you how good this is
3:58
smelling but because i want that extra
4:01
sauce to the same seasoned container
4:04
just going to rinse that with some water
4:06
and add to the chicken
4:18
now i'm going to cover again for another
4:20
10 minutes until the potatoes are fully
4:23
cooked
4:25
[Music]
4:27
and that's it
4:29
it is ready it's as simple as that and
4:32
this would be one of the best tasting
4:34
core you'll ever have the sauce is thick
4:37
and flavorful
4:39
and it's no time to serve
4:43
