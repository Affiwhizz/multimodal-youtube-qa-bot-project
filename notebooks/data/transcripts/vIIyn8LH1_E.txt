This is the way I've been making efro
0:02
now. It comes together very quickly. It
0:05
tastes unique and delicious. It's not
0:08
your typical efro. If you want to see
0:11
how to make it, keep watching. Don't

0:23
These are the ingredients we'll be using
0:25
for the eoriro. Um what makes this
0:27
particular efro unique is the vegetable
0:29
I'm using. I'm using spinach. This
0:32
spinach you can find it in supermarkets
0:35
or with your local vendor. That is where
0:38
I get it from. People are always asking
0:40
me where they can find this particular
0:42
kind of spinach.
0:44
I have tatache here. It has been steamed
0:47
and then blended. I also have some dried
0:51
prawns. I love it because it's going to
0:54
be giving a deep smoky flavor to the E
0:57
foro. You can skip u but it's not going
1:02
to be let's say traditional without the
1:05
eu. Sometimes I make it without u if I
1:07
don't have u but it would be nice to
1:10
have completely optional. I also have
1:14
fresh prawns big prawns. I like to have
1:17
this in my eoriro.
1:20
I have some blended crayfish as no
1:23
Nigerian soup is complete without
1:25
crayfish. Actually, a lot of Nigerian
1:28
soups use it. I have some smoked squala
1:31
fish. I wanted to use smoked catfish,
1:34
but I changed my mind. I use smoked
1:36
mala. You can use smoked catfish if you
1:38
want. Makes it taste good. I have some
1:41
pomod that I have in the freezer and I
1:44
was like, you need to come into the
1:45
soup. Get in here.
1:48
I'll also be using some onion for this
1:50
recipe, some palm oil. I like to add a
1:55
bit of palm oil and a bit of vegetable
1:57
oil. To season, I have some salt and
2:01
some beeftock powder. And that's about
2:03
it. So, let's start cooking.
2:07
I have goat meat here. It has been
2:10
washed. I'm going to add my onion. I'm
2:14
going to add my salt. I'm going to add
2:17
my beef seasoning. And then I'm going to
2:19
add some of that um blended tatache and
2:23
some pepper. Mix everything together and
2:26
allow to boil till it is soft.
2:30
[Music]
2:45
[Music]
2:52
In a pan, I'm going to add some palm
2:55
oil. I'll allow it to heat up a bit
2:58
before I add my vegetable oil. Sometimes
3:00
I use just palm oil. So, I differentiate
3:04
my ephoro based on what I want to eat it
3:06
with. Sometimes I have ephoriro that
3:09
strictly for like pounded yam, amala,
3:11
eba. That's proper soup. But this
3:15
ephoriro is for rice, is for yam, is for
3:18
plantain. So that's why I'm adding a
3:20
little bit of vegetable oil. So that's
3:22
how I differentiate my effort. Now I'm
3:26
going to add my dried prawns. I'm just
3:29
trying to build flavor in the oil. And
3:31
then I'm adding my u like I said that is
3:34
optional. Mix everything together. Once
3:37
it fries a bit, I'm going to add my
3:39
blended crayfish. I did not add the
3:41
blended crayfish first because it can
3:43
easily burn when you're frying it. So, I
3:45
just want it to fry for just a few
3:47
seconds before we add the pepper.
3:56
Add the blended tatache. I like to blend
3:59
it roughly so that once I'm um seeing
4:02
the eoriro, I can be seeing like chunks
4:05
of redness. That's how I like it. I'm
4:09
also going to put a bit of blended
4:11
tatache, the one that I blend smoothly
4:14
and it has been boiled. This is one of
4:16
those things that I prep in the fridge.
4:18
It makes it easy to make anything. Let's
4:21
say you're about to fry egg, just bring
4:23
a spoonful of that. You're about to make
4:25
jalof fries, bring a couple of spoons of
4:27
that and add it. So, I've just added it
4:30
now. Mix everything together and make a
4:34
sauce with it.
4:38
Ephoro is one of those soaps I make at
4:41
least once a week. I make it once a week
4:43
or sometimes once in two weeks because
4:46
we eat it a lot in my house and I make
4:48
it in under like 30 minutes. In under 30
4:52
minutes I finished my forro. I have
4:54
other soups that I always make. They're
4:56
delicious. The recipes are fantastic.
4:59
Quick and easy because that's my style
5:01
but still delicious. Still authentic. I
5:05
have those recipes in my description box
5:08
where my caption is. I put all my
5:10
favorite Nigerian soups, over 30 of
5:13
them, soups, stews, and sauces. I put
5:16
them in a book and you can download it
5:18
to your phone when it's time to make a
5:20
soup. You bring out that ebook and you
5:23
can see the recipe, the list of
5:24
ingredients and how to prepare it. The
5:27
link to download is in my description
5:29
box or just Google CCME Nigerian soup
5:33
stews and sauces. It's also available on
5:36
Amazon if you want physical copy.
5:40
[Applause]
5:42
Now for the sauce, I've already added
5:44
some salt, some seasoning, the guo, the
5:48
fish. I like to fry my meat before
5:50
adding it to it because like I said,
5:52
this is a foruo stew. That's what I'll
5:55
call it. E foro stew. I want to eat it
5:57
with rice. But if I was making the
6:00
traditional one for like fufu pedam. I'm
6:04
not going to fry the meat. I'm just
6:06
going to put it in there like that. At
6:08
the end of the day, just do what you
6:10
like because it's your pot of soup.
6:13
Anyways, at this point, I'm going to add
6:15
my big prawns. Mix everything together.
6:18
Uh, once I've added the prawns, I know
6:20
that the soup is ready because it
6:22
doesn't really take long to cook your
6:25
prawns.
6:27
[Music]
6:46
I've already washed and cut the spinach
6:48
and I'm just going to add it to the
6:50
sauce. Allow it to simmer till it is
6:54
soft.
6:56
[Music]
7:16
This is what my ephorero stew looks
7:19
like. Fun fact, before I did the voice
7:21
over, I already had a portion with
7:24
steaming hot white rice. I hope you try
7:28
this recipe. It is really easy to make.
