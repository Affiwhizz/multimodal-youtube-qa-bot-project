0:04
very fatty forgot the one Charlie the
0:07
sausages this is the cousin of carbonara
0:10
and the brother-in-law of ahmatri Jana
0:13
they combined these two ingredients
0:15
together and that's what you get oh it's
0:17
such a beautiful underrated dish not
0:19
many people know about this but today
0:21
you can make this dish famous so try it
0:24
love it and share it with everyone come
0:27
on let's make it together
0:37
good
0:39
I'm going to eat it now
0:41
[Music]
0:48
to make pasta salad we need rigatoni
Ingredients for Pasta alla Zozzona
0:51
pasta why because you want the sausage
0:55
that when Charlie the peeled tomatoes to
0:57
go in there beautiful you get into these
1:00
beautiful flavors every time you have a
1:02
bite of rigatoni I'm using 300 grams
1:05
which is about a little bit more than
1:07
half packet of pasta three eggs so every
1:10
100 grams of pasta one egg one thick
1:14
Italian sausage about 150 grams of
1:17
guanciale the pig Chick Half onion
1:20
chopped into small pieces two small cans
1:23
of peeled tomatoes so every can is like
1:26
400 grams you need two of them pecorino
1:29
Romano in you know like a good carbonara
1:31
and it's pecorino romano and this is the
1:33
cousin of carbonara about three
1:35
tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil
1:37
some nice fresh basil salt and pepper
1:40
and now we're ready to cook if you come
1:42
find one Charlie you can use pancetta or
1:45
you can use a bacon but use bacon as a
1:48
last resort because bacon is smoked this
1:51
pancetta in guanciale are cured so they
1:54
give you different experience okay but
1:56
if you can't really find them just use
1:58
bacon first thing we want to do see
2:00
we've got this beautiful peeled tomatoes
2:02
look how nice they are they're so good
2:05
we get a fork and we just squash them on
2:08
the fork gently take your time okay now
2:11
we gently do this and then when we start
2:13
cooking the sauce you will see they
2:15
disintegrated they become sauce the next
2:18
step is the guanciale this guanciale I'm
2:21
using which is the big chick has lots of
2:24
you know pepper over there and herbs
2:26
plastic skin what we're gonna do is we
2:29
are going to remove the skin
2:31
always remove the skin
2:35
because we don't need it
2:37
and see this I've got way too much
2:39
pepper way too many herbs and that you
2:42
know that's the way this one was made so
2:44
I'm gonna remove it because I think this
2:46
is too much for a dish we just want the
2:49
meat
2:51
which already has the flavors but we
2:53
want to remove this one just like a
2:55
carbonara what we're going to do
2:57
is we are going to cut this
3:00
into strips
3:04
so first we cut into slices the meat in
3:08
the middle fat and fat that's what we
3:11
want
3:12
we cut into strip just like that
3:17
okay
3:20
this is what we want to achieve
3:22
fat meat fat
3:25
flavors that comes from these is just so
3:27
unique that's why you need guanciale
3:30
[Music]
3:36
this is the Italian sausage okay what
3:39
we're gonna do is
3:40
remove the skin so you just need to cut
3:43
it
3:49
some people like to use a skin I don't
3:51
and what you can just wash it like that
3:55
before we put it inside
3:58
fry pan squash it
4:01
this way it's easier to to cook okay all
How to Make the Sauce
4:05
right here we have a beautiful fry pan
4:07
we want to cook this gently we are on a
4:10
medium or low heat we're gonna put three
4:14
tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil
4:17
and then we're gonna add the onion
4:21
and then gently we want to
4:24
cook the onion saute the onion for at
4:27
least seven minutes
4:29
gently
4:32
now we'll let this Sizzle gently
4:36
for about seven minutes at least because
4:39
the onion is beautiful and golden look
4:41
how beautiful it is now it's time for
4:42
the guanciale we're going to put the
4:44
guanciale first
4:46
so that we can make the fat nice and
4:50
crispy
4:51
now this fat is meant to reduce to
4:55
become oil okay so let's spread it
4:57
around
4:59
and cook this beautiful guanciale
5:02
[Music]
5:07
see now the guanciale release the oil
5:10
it's cooking it's becoming crispy at
5:14
this point
5:15
I want to add the sausage I put the
5:18
sausage in
5:19
quickly
5:22
spread it we want the sausage the
5:24
guanciale and the onion to make love
5:27
together it's all about making love
5:30
and now we're suppressing a little bit
5:33
because we want the sausage to be
5:37
not too big chunks you know but in
5:39
little pieces at this point some people
5:41
like to add white wine you can do that
5:45
you can put water
5:47
I just want to leave it the way it is
5:49
because I like the oil from the Guin
5:52
Charlie what I prefer to do is to add a
5:54
little bit more extra virgin olive oil
5:57
to help the sausage
5:59
to cook and also the sausage will absorb
6:02
a little bit of oil so
6:04
let's do that so I'm noticing this one
6:07
Charlie I have the fat is not really
6:09
becoming crispy like when I'm in Rome
6:11
the one Charlie that I have in wrong so
6:14
I'm assuming you know sometimes meat
6:16
reacts differently not sure why the one
6:19
shot is reacting this way uh you know it
6:21
should be crisp yeah
6:23
that's okay now at this point the
6:26
sausages are ready because they are gray
6:29
almost brown okay and they're nice and
6:32
tender if one shot is ready the onions
6:35
are definitely ready we can now add the
6:38
peel tomatoes okay now these spilled
6:41
tomatoes
6:43
smells so good put it in
6:46
and I want to be very generous with the
6:48
sauce that's why I'm using two cans of
6:50
peeled tomatoes because I like my sauce
6:53
I do like my sauce in the pasta
6:56
I'll mix everything together
6:59
and from this moment okay we want to
7:02
cook this together for about 30 minutes
7:05
at least on a medium low heat
7:08
30 minutes
7:11
because they do need to make love
7:12
together you can do it quickly if you
7:14
want and doing 15 minutes at a high heat
7:17
but I don't recommend you to do it
7:21
just take your time when you do this and
7:23
I'll give a quick stir okay perfect what
7:25
we do now is we put the lid on now we're
7:28
gonna cook this for about half an hour
7:29
in the meantime I don't know open a
7:32
bottle of wine
7:33
put some music on do a little dance and
7:36
then when you finish this will be ready
7:38
look how beautiful this sauce looks
7:40
after 15 minutes now what we can do
7:44
the peeled tomato is nice and soft right
7:47
now so with the spoon you can squeeze it
7:51
to help you know to release more juice
7:53
now I'm gonna get some salt
7:57
let's be generous and pepper as much as
8:00
you like
8:03
now here we have boiling water a nice
How to Cook Pasta
8:05
large pot of boiling water we're gonna
8:08
add a tablespoon of generous tablespoon
8:10
of sea salt right in there beautiful
8:14
and now we can add the rigatoni
8:16
[Music]
8:19
the rigatoni pasta takes 13 minutes to
8:22
be ready to be Al Dente and we're gonna
8:24
boil them for 13 minutes
8:29
now when you put the pasta in the pot
8:31
always stir it okay we have 13 minutes
8:35
for boiling the pasta so do this two
8:39
more times you know the stirring because
8:40
we don't want the pasta to get stuck to
8:42
the bottom
8:43
now we can make the egg mix the
How to Make the Egg Mix
8:45
carbonara egg mix okay so to make the
8:48
carbonara mix for pasta we need
8:52
egg yolks only okay only egg yolks so
8:55
what do we do with the egg white well
8:57
you can make Amaretti so you can go to
8:59
my website or YouTube channel and make
9:01
Amaretti biscuits a very easy process in
9:05
20 minutes you can make the Beautiful
9:08
I'm already biscuits and everybody will
9:11
love it and they are gluten free to egg
9:13
yolks
9:14
don't forget it's one egg yolk or every
9:18
100 grams of pasta and now we're just
9:21
gonna
9:22
mix the eggs first beat the eggs first
9:26
and now is the Magic Moment the pecorino
9:29
moment the pecorino Romano we're gonna
9:32
add about four tablespoon okay four
9:35
generous tablespoons
9:38
I know it sounds a lot if it's too much
9:41
for you maybe you can mix parmigiano and
9:43
pecorino parmigiano is more delicate or
9:46
use less cheese for me
9:49
the cheese here is very important to get
9:52
the cream that we want okay so
9:55
this is very nice and thick
9:57
let's put some black pepper
10:00
when I have some a black pepper going in
10:02
it
10:04
to make it more carbonara look
10:09
okay very very very thick
10:12
which is good which is what we want to
10:14
achieve because now I'm gonna add the
10:16
pasta water in here
10:18
to make it runny I collected some pasta
10:21
water and this is very important to
10:23
combine our ingredients so put it there
10:25
not too much a little bit at a time to
10:28
see how much you need
10:31
also the heat for the pasta water will
10:34
kind of
10:35
cook the eggs
10:39
you see what's happening here can you
10:40
see
10:42
we do want this mix to be runny because
10:45
this is going over the sauce and it
10:48
should combine well with the sauce
10:53
so this is actually very very good ready
10:56
now we can combine all the ingredients
10:59
together
11:07
oh look how beautiful it looks after
Combine the Sauce with Pasta
11:10
half an hour
11:11

11:15

11:20
carbonara ingredients
11:23
