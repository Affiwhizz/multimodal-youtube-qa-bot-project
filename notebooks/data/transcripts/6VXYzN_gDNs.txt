0:02
to make one of the best Ghan stews ever
0:04
cont stew people are always asking Abby
0:07
when are you making conon Rue well today
0:09
my people today I'm making C Rue today
0:13
and it's really simple you guys will
0:14
love this one let's get started all you
0:16
need is your tomato mix well proportion
0:19
tomato mix actually so here we have some
0:21
purpose I'm using the red and the green
0:23
two bell peppers one carrot six tomatoes
0:26
one onion garlic ginger bay leaf and
0:29
then I'm just going going to blend this
0:31
I like to mix my tomatoes with these
0:33
ingredients because it gives it a good
0:35
mix it brings out the flavor and it also
0:37
mix the tomatoes less itchy or sour now
0:40
that our tomato mix is ready you're
0:42
going to work on your aushi now we use
0:43
melon seeds to make contous you that is
0:46
aushi here in Ghana and I think AI in
0:48
Nigeria I don't know the other countries
0:50
but I just know Nigeria now I'm just
0:52
going to add two eggs to this add in
0:54
some water do not add a lot of water
0:57
because you don't want it to be washy
0:58
you want it to become like paste form
1:01
just like this now carefully combine
1:03
everything together you can do without
1:05
the eggs if you don't like eggs in your
1:07
cont you or you can even just use eggs
1:10
without using the aushi but if you want
1:11
it to be very very nice then you can mix
1:14
the two together and that's it now our
1:16
paste is ready I just going to set this
1:18
aside and prep your meat okay I'm using
1:21
cow meat and then will so I'm just going
1:23
to wash this very well and then add it
1:25
to my sauce pan and then just steam it's
1:27
okay so I'm going to add my usual pepper
1:29
mix if you don't you don't know my usual
1:30
pepper mix I'm going to fight with you H
1:33
you don't know my usual pepper mix how
1:35
but if you don't know it I have it
1:37
listed in the caption or the description
1:39
box please check it out now just going
1:40
to add some water and then seasoning I
1:42
use my usual seasonings my Remy chicken
1:45
Remy beef Magi Cube mix the three into
1:47
one seasoning and then use it to season
1:49
my proteins whilst that is cooking
1:51
you're just going to cook your cont as
1:54
well okay or your cocoyam leaves now
1:56
just add everything into your sauce pan
1:58
and then add a little bit of water
2:00
because cont itself has water in it and
2:02
that is why I always prefer you cook the
2:04
cont on the side and not add it to the
2:06
stew because the water can go into the
2:08
stew and your stew could become bitter
2:10
or you start like getting that itchiness
2:12
in your throat you wouldn't want that so
2:13
cook it on the side and to prep your
2:15
Contour to make sure you wash it very
2:17
well with salt and use a very green type
2:20
okay but if you do all this and you
2:22
still get that scratch or itchiness in
2:24
your throat then maybe you could be
2:26
allergic to conty now you're just going
2:28
to check on your meat and then my meat
2:30
is well cooked I cook this meat for 45
2:32
minutes I like to cook my meat for a
2:34
very long time so that it will become
2:35
very tender okay and cow meat is not so
2:37
hard but then you just need to cook it
2:39
well that's all so first 5 minutes
2:41
maximum and that's it is ready now just
2:43
going to assemble all your ingredients
2:44
in your sauce pan adding some palm oil I
2:46
like a lot of palm oil and then add in
2:49
some M money oil cured fish okay this
2:51
just gives it more flavor and it makes
2:53
the still taste very local now add in
2:56
your onions I'm using three large onions
2:58
here cuz you need to use a lot of onions
3:00
in your stew now add in some natural
3:02
spices this is a jaar spice I like to
3:04
base it up with my onions just to bring
3:06
out more flavor now you just want to
3:08
pour your tomato mix into it really
3:10
simple and because we Blended everything
3:12
with our Tomatoes it makes it very
3:14
simple to cook cuz you've already
3:16
blended it all up so just pour and cook
3:18
at this point you can just give the stew
3:20
a good mix cover the stew and let that
3:22
stew cook can you see that really simple
3:25
everyone can make this at home and you
3:28
can use the same method to make Garden
3:29
next stew the same method to make all
3:32
those palm oil stews you know very
3:34
simple I cooked my stew for 45 minutes
3:37
exactly like exactly 45 minutes and this
3:39
is what we have the oil settled on top
3:41
and you just know that the stew is ready
3:44
properly when your oil starts to settle
3:45
that like a sign for you to season it
3:48
now I'm just going to season my stew
3:49
with one Maggi Cube and then some
3:51
natural spices I like natural spices a
3:53
lot so I'm just going to season that and
3:55
I don't want to do too much with the
3:56
seasoning because con you it can become
3:59
very salty if you don't take care and
4:00
I'm going to add tuna and then I'm going
4:02
to add stock as well like the meat stock
4:05
stock is actually like seasoning so it's
4:07
going to add to the taste of it and then
4:09
the tuna also has some salty taste to it
4:11
so don't do too much with the seasoning
4:13
you guys at this point you want to add
4:14
the aushi add it the way I'm adding it
4:17
like just like this you don't want to do
4:19
anything else apart from this because
4:21
aguchi is a very delicate thing it could
4:23
mess up your stew so make some round
4:26
balls with aushi just to cook it well
4:28
and then cover this now I'm just going
4:30
to cook it for 15 minutes take it off
4:32
and then check on the aushi now you just
4:34
want to mix the aushi a little bit
4:37
before you cover and let it cook well
4:38
okay I'm doing this to spread the aushi
4:40
in the stew and also to make the top
4:42
part cook well can you see that I'm
4:44
going to cover the stew again to cook
4:46
the aushi properly so in general I cook
4:48
my aushi for 30 minutes because I want
4:51
the aushi to cook very well so 15
4:53
minutes for this 15 minutes for the
4:55
second part can you see that and please
4:57
take your time when you're doing this
4:58
cuz you want that gushy to look really
4:59
good in this you so don't mess it up
5:01
don't don't do too much just take your
5:03
time cover this and then cover it and
5:06
let it cook for another 15 minutes and
5:08
you know what aushi has a bter taste you
5:10
can even taste it at this point you will
5:11
see that the stew is tasting bter do not
5:14
worry I have a trick for that that is
5:16
why I add the stock to cook the aushi
5:18
it's just my technique that I do I add a
5:21
stock so that it can recook the aushi
5:23
and then also bring out a good taste
5:25
from it so I'm going to add the protein
5:27
and the stock all together mix it like
5:30
this and then cover this and let it cook
5:32
for just 10 minutes this way it's going
5:34
to reduce the bitterness it's going to
5:36
just bring out a good flavor and then
5:38
you guys you are going to enjoy this you
5:40
so much but if you don't have stock you
5:43
can add water just a little bit of water
5:46
to it cover that and let it cook okay
5:48
but then the stock just brings out a
5:50
good flavor you get it cuz stock is
5:51
already flavor otherwise you can just
5:53
use a little water to cook it and this
5:55
is how your Gushi is going to look like
5:57
after 10 minutes can you see that
6:00
can you guys see that now you can add
6:02
your cont to it and then carefully
6:04
combine the cont is already cooked so
6:06
this is just formalities you're just
6:08
going to mix it all together and your
6:11
aushi or your Contour M skew is ready
6:15
now you can finally taste the stew and
6:16
if the seasoning is not enough you can
6:19
just adjust it a bit okay and that's it
6:21
guys your Contour stew is ready just let
6:24
it cook for 5 minutes so that the oil
6:25
will settle on top and then it will be
6:27
looking so good like this oh oh my God
6:30
