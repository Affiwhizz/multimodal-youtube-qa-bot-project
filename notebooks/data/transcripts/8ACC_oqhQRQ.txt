Today I'm going to show you another
0:02
interesting way to make my moy. This one
0:05
is a must try. So like you do with your
0:07
regular moy, start by peeling the beans.
0:10
So I have some brown beans here. You can
0:12
use white or brown beans. Okay. Now I
0:14
soaked the beans for 2 minutes, not more
0:16
than that. Add it to my food processor.
0:18
Add enough water to this. And then go in
0:20
with a pulse setting. You want to crush
0:22
it a little bit. One, two, three times
0:24
with a pulse setting is fine. Pour that
0:27
into a large enough bowl. Add enough
0:29
water and then loosen it up with your
0:31
palm a little bit. And then it can now
0:33
begin to pass through a se to catch the
0:36
shaft.
0:46

0:59
love you all so much. Thank you for
1:01
always coming back to watch.
1:12
Now the beans is clean. I'm going to set
1:14
this aside.
1:27
Grab one coconut or more depending on
1:29
how much my mo you're making. I'm going
1:31
to leave a detailed list and measurement
1:33
of everything that I'm using today in
1:35
the description box. Now, you're going
1:37
to crack it open with a blunt object.
1:39
I'm using um the blunt side of a knife.
1:42
You can also use a hammer. Pry out the
1:44
meat very carefully. Rinse and then cut
1:46
this up into small pieces so that that
1:49
way it's easier to blend.
1:57
[Music]
2:23
Transfer the cutup coconut into a
2:26
blender. Add some warm water and blend
2:28
till smooth.
2:38
To catch the shaft, get a chiffon cloth,
2:41
place it over a bowl like this, and then
2:43
pour in the mixture. We're going to
2:46
squeeze this out until there's no more
2:47
milk left in the shaft. I know you're
2:50
thinking it's a lot of work. No, it is
2:52
not. But if you want to use a canned
2:54
coconut milk, go ahead. I just know that
2:57
this one will give you that authentic
2:59
coconut taste.
3:15
For the pepper mix, you'll need some red
3:17
bell pepper, onion, scotch bonnet, and
3:19
crayfish. Do you add crayfish to your
3:21
momo? If you don't, why? Let me know in
3:24
the comments. All right, so remove the
3:26
seed from the red bell pepper. Cut them
3:27
up into small pieces like this. Add to
3:30
your blender and blend till smooth.
3:50
You also want to boil some eggs, peel
3:52
them, and cut them in half like this.
3:54
We'll need it for our moy moy. Now to
3:56
fry your pepper mix, go in with some
3:59
vegetable oil. You can add a mix of palm
4:01
oil and vegetable oil. You can also use
4:04
only palm oil, either of both. Okay. Now
4:06
once it heats up, add your blended
4:08
pepper mix. Add some ground crayfish
4:11
seasoning to taste and mix well. If you
4:13
like to add curry, thyme, whatever kind
4:15
of seasoning you like to add to your
4:17
moy, please go ahead. All right.
4:40
Cooked or smoked mackerel in my moy is
4:42
very delicious. So I have some here
4:44
which I'm going to cook with some
4:45
seasoning. I think that was um curry,
4:48
thyme, onion powder, some seasoning and
4:50
a bit of water. It doesn't take 5
4:53
minutes. So, just cook it, deon it, and
4:56
set it aside.
5:00
Quick check on the sauce. It's been
5:01
going for about 7 minutes now. I'm going
5:04
to give it a quick mix. And then add
5:06
your deboned fish. Please try to take
5:09
out as many bones as possible from the
5:12
mackerel. Okay. So, add that, give it a
5:14
good mix, and let it come together for
5:16
another 3 minutes.

5:32
3 minutes later, give you one final stir
5:34
and take it off the heat.
5:50
The washed beans have been soaking in
5:52
water. So now I'm going to transfer it
5:54
into a blender. Add our coconut milk,
5:57
some onion, and blend this till it is
5:59
smooth.
6:12
Once that is nice and smooth, pour that
6:14
into a bowl. I rinsed out the jar with a
6:17
bit of coconut milk. And now guys, see
6:20
how creamy this looks? Beautiful.
6:35
At this time, you can now pour in the
6:36
sauce and mix well to combine. You can
6:39
go in gradually if you think the sauce
6:40
is too much. Although I ended up using
6:43
everything. Also, you want to taste and
6:45
adjust with seasoning or salt if
6:47
necessary. I had some of the fish stock,
6:49
so I'm going to add that. That was
6:51
already properly seasoned, so I added
6:53
some of that and a little bit of salt.
6:55
Now, mix this well to combine. Then, it
6:57
is time to wrap.

7:12
Thank you.
7:27
to wrap this. Today I'm going to use my
7:29
moy leaf. You can use my moy pouch. The
7:32
tins, remember those um aluminum tins
7:35
that we used to have those days? Oh my
7:36
god. I even think the moy that is cooked
7:39
inside that thing tastes a bit different
7:42
in a good way deliciously different. My
7:45
second best option would be my moy wrap
7:48
that is this one the leave. Okay so
7:50
clean it very well you know do it the
7:52
way I have done it. I like to remove the
7:53
stem from the edge so that I can wrap it
7:56
up easily. Now we are going to assemble
7:58
everything. Bring your eggs and then add
8:00
your um moy batter into the leaf. Try
8:03
not to fill it up too much so it doesn't
8:05
bust open. Add one moy um sorry, add one
8:09
egg to this. Close it. And that's it.
8:12
Repeat the process until everything is
8:14
done. I'm going to show you one more
8:15
time how to wrap this.
8:59
When you're almost done wrapping, add
9:00
some water into a pot. Add some myoyo
9:03
leaf stem. In this case, I didn't have
9:04
it, so I added the leaves. And then
9:07
continue wrapping so that by the time
9:08
you're done, that should already come to
9:10
a boil. And then you can now place the
9:12
wrapped momoy into the pot. Cover it up
9:14
with some leaves and let this cook for
9:16
about 45 minutes to an hour.
9:29
You won't need anyone to tell you it is
9:31
cooked after about an hour because you
9:33
would perceive that distinct my moy
9:35
aroma. Okay. So, remove the leaves at
9:37
this point and then we are going to take
9:39
it off the heat. Don't do what I'm
9:42
doing. Know I am an fire born.
9:47
So, I was dipping my hand in some cold
9:48
water. Anyway, I'm going to take this
9:50
out and place them in this tray and it
9:53
is ready to be served. The best way to
9:55
store this is to let them cool
9:57
completely, pack them into a container
9:59
and keep in your fridge, not freezer. I
10:01
don't keep my mom in the freezer. And
10:03
that's it. And have this with oats, with
10:05
gary, with pap. Enjoy. Let me know if
10:08
you be trying this in a comment. See you
10:10
in my next video. Bye.
10:30
Hey, hey, hey.
