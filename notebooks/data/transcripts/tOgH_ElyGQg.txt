hello and welcome to simple french
0:16
cooking my name is francois
0:18
and today i'm standing out here in my
0:19
garden in vermont it's a
0:21
beautiful sunny day i just picked these
0:24
beautiful
0:25
shallots and i want to teach you one of
0:27
my favorite classic bistro dishes it's
0:30
sauteed of chicken in a vinegar sauce
0:34
oh god this is gonna be awesome so come
0:36
join me in the kitchen
0:38
and let's get cooking
0:45
good ingredients are the foundation to
0:48
great cuisine
0:49
you are what you eat you know take for
0:51
instance this chicken this chicken comes
0:53
from foggy brook farm in fairfield
0:55
vermont these are my local chicken
0:57
producers
0:58
i mean it's an amazing chicken what i
1:00
love about it it's got more
1:02
flavor and more texture than just a
1:04
store-bought chicken
1:06
i know they raise these chickens really
1:08
well because i can see like the yellow
1:10
fat i mean it's just you probably can't
1:12
see it on camera but
1:14
it's just a beautiful chicken you know
1:16
the shallots came from my garden i just
1:18
picked them a few seconds ago
1:20
one of the components of this dish is
1:22
tomato concentrate now you could use
1:24
tomato paste certainly a lot of recipes
1:26
online
1:27
or in the older french cookbooks they
1:30
use tomato paste
1:32
i took a tomato that i grew in my garden
1:35
and i just slowly cooked it to reduce
1:38
down and to me it's just got a better
1:40
flavor anyways let's get cooking
1:43
[Music]
1:45
so obviously i'm not seasoning my sheet
1:48
pan here what i'm doing is
1:50
putting my seasonings on the sheet pan
1:52
and then i'm going to put my chicken in
1:54
there and i find that i get a really
1:56
nice
1:57
even mix of seasoning on on my chicken
2:00
so i'm using black pepper salt
2:04
and just a little bit of herbs to
2:05
provide you know my go-to's
2:08
now just break down your chicken you
2:10
just want the winged sections
2:13
um you want the legs and thighs
2:16
separate and then the breast and that's
2:19
it
2:19
i've done this a bunch of times so i
2:21
speeded it up just a hair
2:26
[Music]
2:30
you know if you want you can make your
2:32
life much simpler and just buy a chicken
2:34
that's already cut up but
2:36
i like to do the whole chickens because
2:38
that way i have the carcass at the end
2:39
and then i can make stock
2:41
and be sure to get that little oyster
2:43
behind the thigh that is the
2:44
best part
2:49
and if you don't want to watch me
2:51
breaking down this chicken just jump to
2:53
the next chapter
2:55
look down below in the notes and you'll
2:57
see that
3:09
[Music]
3:29
[Music]
3:36
now i want my chicken skin crispy so i'm
3:38
going to
3:39
dip the skin side in a little bit of
3:41
flour
3:42
if you don't want to eat flour or you're
3:45
gluten free just simply skip it it
3:47
really honestly makes such a small
3:58
difference
4:00
[Music]
4:03
all right time to start cooking the
4:05
chicken now i'm using a mixture of
4:08
oil and butter butter straight
4:11
you might just burn the butter oil helps
4:13
kind of raise the
4:15
temperature that you can cook in and
4:17
once you get it nice and brown
4:19
put all the pieces skin side down and
4:21
just cook them together
4:23
beautifully golden brown i just love the
4:27
smell of chicken cooking
4:35
all right and once they've browned on
4:37
one side
4:38
just flip them over and put a nice sear
4:41
on the other side
4:45
[Music]
4:54
you know so i got the idea to make this
4:56
dish because i was watching
4:58
videos on youtube and i saw paul
5:00
burkus's chef
5:02
uh making this and as a tribute to paul
5:04
bakus
5:06
and it's just it's a dish i love
5:10
i mean it's a simple dish you have it
5:12
all throughout french history you have
5:14
various versions
5:16
in the old days they made it with
5:17
demi-glacis version today it's going to
5:19
be made with chicken stock
5:20
[Applause]
5:22
some people use homemade tomato
5:24
concentrate some people use tomato paste
5:26
some people put tomato some use
5:28
shallots i saw one recipe that used like
5:32
20 heads of garlic i mean it's crazy
5:34
so there's a wide variety but the
5:37
essence of the sauce is made from
5:38
vinegar and
5:40
i don't know if you know but the word
5:42
vinegar means
5:43
um acidic wine uh
5:47
somewhere over here there i put a
5:49
graphic so you can see
5:51
the origins of the word anyways we're
5:53
going to take our shallots
5:55
and i always save these green tops you
5:58
know
5:59
first of all you can use them in
6:00
anything like that where you'd use green
6:03
onions
6:04
i mean it's exactly that lately i've
6:06
been making a chinese dish
6:08
of
6:12
a spare rib that's cooked in soy
6:16
and mirin with like
6:20
all of these just cut into one-inch
6:22
sections and it's
6:23
slowly braised for about
6:27
i don't know an hour two hours until the
6:28
meat's tender uh it's just a wonderful
6:31
chinese dish
6:32
uh i use this in stir fry so don't ever
6:35
throw that stuff away
6:36
it worst case compost it and give it to
6:38
your garden
6:39
and so we're just gonna trim the ends
6:41
off of our
6:43
shallots my shallots in the yard started
6:47
forming skins
6:49
these will keep for a long time if you
6:50
do grow them at home
6:53
but anyways let's just get them all
6:54
trimmed up
7:01
i just trimmed the ends off of your
7:03
shallots
7:05
then i'm going to peel the outer layer
7:07
um
7:09
you know you don't you don't want a hard
7:11
hour or layer because
7:12
it's going to be it just would be tough
7:15
when you're
7:16
eating it and then i just dice it as
7:18
fine as i can
7:19
[Music]
7:20
the shouts kind of melt away in the dish
7:23
they add a sweetness
7:25
that counter balances the vinegar and
7:27
the sauce
7:31
[Music]
7:43
once the chicken is fully browned on
7:45
both sides just
7:46
remove it keep it to the side we're
7:48
going to be adding it back
7:49
soon uh now just add a little butter to
7:53
the pan and
7:54
you know if i were in a restaurant i
7:55
might be compelled to use a fresh pan
7:59
but when i'm cooking it at home i don't
8:01
mind little bits of the
8:02
the chicken and the sauce to me adds to
8:05
the rustic quality
8:07
all right so we're gonna drop our
8:08
shallots in and just saute them
8:10
for about five minutes we're just
8:12
looking for them to get soft
8:15
be sure to season them up with a little
8:16
bit of salt and pepper and
8:18
make sure you stir them the last thing
8:20
you want is to burn them
8:26
now we're going to add the vinegar in
8:28
two stages
8:30
now i'm adding probably about half a cup
8:31
of vinegar in total
8:33
but really what we're not trying to do
8:36
is boil the shallots you know we're just
8:38
deglazing the pan
8:40
and reducing it down then we're adding a
8:42
little more vinegar
8:43
and we're gonna let that cook a bit then
8:46
add our tomato concentrate that we made
8:48
or you could put a tablespoon of tomato
8:51
paste if
8:52
you don't have your own homemade tomato
8:54
concentrate
8:57
and then just stir it up into the sauce
8:59
get it nice and mixed in
9:01
and then we're gonna add our chicken
9:04
stock and
9:04
my chicken stock has so much gelatin and
9:07
it comes
9:08
from the foggy brook chickens i buy
9:12
there's just so much gelatin in it
9:13
anyways we're going to drop our
9:15
chicken pieces in
9:19
bring this up to a boil lower it down to
9:21
a simmer cover it and just let it
9:23
cook until the chicken thighs are thin
9:27
now bear in mind the breasts will
9:29
probably done long before the
9:32
thighs so be sure to take them out in
9:34
probably about 20 minutes or so
9:37
now your cooking time will vary because
9:39
if you're using a store-bought chicken
9:41
it'll probably cook a little bit quicker
9:44
anyways let's cover it up and let it
9:48
cook
9:50
[Music]
9:59
one of the key components of the dish
10:01
obviously is the vinegar
10:03
kind of hard to have chicken sauteed in
10:05
a vinegar sauce
10:07
without vinegar now i've seen a lot of
10:11
recipes that
10:12
at public uses restaurant they use red
10:14
wine vinegar
10:15
that is a great choice
10:19
but for me i decided to use a champagne
10:22
vinegar from toulouse vineyards in
10:24
california
10:25
now first of all toulouse is one of the
10:28
best vineyards
10:29
in northern california if you love pinot
10:32
noir
10:33
you need to go there and if you've been
10:34
there you already know how cool vern is
10:37
and rita who's the winemaker
10:39
this is a champagne vinegar that rita
10:43
makes
10:43
and she uses 100 fermented pinot noir
10:48
so this is better than the red wine
10:50
vinegar that i have
10:52
so i'm going to use this for this dish
10:54
[Music]
10:55
anyways i think you can buy this online
10:57
from their website
10:59
i'll put a link to their website in the
11:02
in the browser or wherever somewhere
11:03
down here up there over there
11:05
it'll be in the show notes and by the
11:07
way if you are in california
11:10
and you're in the san francisco area
11:12
head up north to mendocino
11:14
be sure to stop by toulouse and taste
11:16
their wines it is amazing
11:19
oh my god my house smells so incredible
11:22
right now
11:23
you're gonna love this dish i promise
11:26
you
11:28
oh god you know and the the vinegar i
11:30
know a lot of people are thinking right
11:32
now that the vinegar is going to make
11:33
this dish really acidic
11:35
and it's not true it just makes the
11:37
flavors more complex on your tongue
11:40
one thing you see in a lot of upscale
11:42
restaurants even some homes is
11:44
people add a couple tablespoons of
11:46
butter to the sauce at the end so
11:48
if you're inclined to do that just add
11:50
it in we're gonna give it a good stir
11:53
i'm also gonna take some tarragon from
11:56
my garden
11:57
and just clip it on the top chicken and
12:00
tarragon
12:00
perfect combination you know and if
12:03
you're looking for a great wine to drink
12:06
i would definitely suggest a burgundy
12:08
birds and birds that's
12:10
that's the general rule in cooking all
12:13
right let's give this a stir and a try
12:17
oh that sauce is so incredible
12:22
i'm drooling i think that's like one of
12:24
the hallmarks of my channel isn't it
12:26
at some point i drool on myself at least
12:28
that's what my wife tells me
12:32
and this is just
12:35
so beautiful all right let's take a
12:38
little piece out here
12:40
on the board actually
12:44
let's take a piece off the breast here
12:52
