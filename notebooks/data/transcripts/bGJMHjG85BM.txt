And this is the finished product from
0:08
chicken kachor.
0:10
M I can't wait. Can I have a bite of
0:11
that?
0:12
Oh, you can have it all.
0:13
Yes, I can't wait. Hi Bella.
0:16
Hi Bella.
0:17
Hi Laura.
0:19
Oi fam chicken.
0:23
Okay. And in English, what does a
0:25
kactori mean? Uh, kachator. It's um
0:29
Anders's chicken. Back in the days, the
0:33
men in the family used to go hunting.
0:36
Uhhuh.
0:36
And the mother used to say, "Bring me a
0:39
wild chicken today so we can make the
0:43
sister would be making pasta home and
0:46
the brother would go hunting and bring a
0:50
nice chicken, wild chicken." And this is
0:53
the way it was prepared.
0:56
years years ago.
0:58
All right. So, what are our ingredients?
1:00
Our ingredients, of course, the main
1:02
star is the chicken.
1:03
Okay.
1:04
Okay. Then then we have the homemade
1:07
tomato sauce, salt and pepper, of
1:10
course, beautiful red and orange bell
1:15
peppers, the olives from our farm, and
1:19
here we have beautiful herbs. We have
1:22
the bay leaf from my tree. You can tell
1:26
that they're nice and green. I just went
1:28
to pick them. And rosemary
1:32
and oregano and basil and onions. I
1:36
don't have it here on the table,
1:38
but we're going to get them.
1:39
Yes. Yes.
1:40
And then a little bit of flour because
1:41
we're going to bread our chicken.
1:43
Yes. We're going to dust the chicken.
1:45
I'm going to cut it properly the way it
1:48
should be. And uh then I'm gonna dust in
1:52
the flour that it's going to be seasoned
1:54
just with salt and pepper.
1:56
Okay, perfect. And then of course some
1:58
uh red wine.
1:59
Oh yes, the red wine. We need that.
2:02
All right, perfect. So what's the first
2:04
step?
2:04
First of all, I'm going to cut the
2:06
chicken. All right,
2:07
so I have a smaller board over here. And
2:10
this one is my little helper.
2:12
All right.
2:12
Okay.
2:14
So I'm going to put this here for now.
2:18
Okay.
2:20
So, I'm going to try my best. I'm going
2:22
to put the chicken back in there.
2:26
Okay. So, let's see. And that's how we
2:30
cut the beautiful wings.
2:33
That's when I I said that I this is my
2:36
help. I
2:38
go like this.
2:40
And it's done.
2:43
And here I just cut a little bit. Let me
2:46
drain this water.
2:49
Okay. And we put the chicken in there.
2:53
And here we have another wing.
2:57
It's very easy, you know, to cut up a
3:00
chicken, but which you can rip I already
3:03
cut
3:05
if you don't want to do this.
3:06
Mhm.
3:10
So now I go to the legs.
3:14
There's a lot of ways to cut the
3:16
chicken. Today I'm going this way.
3:35
You are beautiful.
3:37
Mhm.
3:40
No sweat.
3:41
[Music]
4:06
And this is the spine.
4:12
So this I'm just going to make a little
4:14
cut here. So like that helps to cook
4:17
faster.
4:24
And I'm going to leave the skin
4:29
just because
4:31
it holds the chicken
4:35
better.
4:38
Beautiful.
4:40
And this one see I'm going to save it
4:42
for my dogs.
4:45
I'm going to cook it for them.
4:51
See
4:53
that's the rest of the spine. It's the
4:55
neck over here.
4:58
[Music]
5:02
And the dogs like it.
5:03
Oh, they love it.
5:06
Then I put few meatballs in there. like
5:09
a real Italian dog.
5:10
Yeah.
5:13
And they even say, "Thank you, Nana."
5:18
[Music]
5:22
Okay. Look how easy is to cut the
5:25
breast.
5:27
Go right there.
5:35
[Music]
5:54
And these are very good chickens. Very
5:56
tasty.
5:57
Yeah.
5:57
Yeah.
5:59
These are from a local farmer.
6:01
Yes. Beautiful.
6:08
Look at that.
6:15
So now you are seasoning the chicken.
6:17
Yes. Seasoning the chicken a little bit
6:21
with salt and pepper.
6:25
And then we'll put more after.
6:32
[Music]
6:40
And now we go to the stove.
6:42
You going to mix it first?
6:44
Yeah, we can mix as we go. We can mix it
6:47
now.
6:49
See? Very, very lightly. It's going to
6:51
be like this.
6:52
Okay.
6:53
Okay.
6:54
So, a drop of oil.
6:56
Yeah. Just a little bit.
6:58
And now we put like a tablespoon of
7:02
butter.
7:03
So like that the oil doesn't burn.
7:11
Okay.
7:14
And the problem.
7:23
I think it's better if I use my hand.
7:26
Yeah. As long as you're washing your
7:28
hands afterwards, right?
7:29
Oh, of course.
7:30
[Music]
7:48
Then how long are you going to fry it on
7:49
both sides?
7:50
Uh, we're just going to get a nice light
7:53
golden color.
7:54
Okay. But we're not cooking it through
7:56
because it's got to cook in the sauce.
7:58
Right.
7:58
Exactly. This is just to sear and build
8:03
more flavors.
8:06
You can even do it without the flour,
8:10
but the flour gives more flavor and
8:13
tenderize the meat too.
8:16
Okay.
8:17
See? Beautiful.
8:19
[Music]
8:23
Okay. So, we cut cooked it for a couple
8:25
minutes and now we are going to flip it.
8:27
Yeah.
8:28
All right. Let's see what we got.
8:30
We'll see if it the color that we like.
8:33
What do you think?
8:35
Looks good to me so far.
8:37
Look at that. See how beautiful.
8:43
That's what you want to see. The
8:45
beautiful
8:47
light golden.
8:49
You know,
8:51
look at this. All the pieces are just
8:54
mix.
8:55
Yeah.
8:59
And then a couple more minutes with
9:02
that.
9:03
Yes.
9:04
So, while that's cooking, we're going to
9:05
go cut our peppers and onions.
9:07
Yes.
9:08
Okay.
9:08
Let me get it all ready.
9:10
Okay. We'll be right back.
9:11
Okay. Take care.
9:13
All right. So, now we're going to cut
9:14
the onions. We're going to cut our
9:15
peppers. Get everything all ready.
9:20
This is a nice big onion. So, we use
9:23
half of it.
9:27
Okay. So, I'm going to do this
9:32
[Music]
10:03
So this you're going to do the full
10:04
pepper.
10:05
Yeah, I'm good because they'll taste
10:07
amazing
10:08
and they shrink when you cook them,
10:09
right? So
10:10
a little bit. Yes.
10:14
But I'm going to check in the fridge if
10:16
I have a a green or a yellow for the
10:20
colors.
10:23
All right. It looks like we did have the
10:24
green pepper.
10:25
Oh, yeah.
10:28
I'm just going to use one more piece
10:31
from here.
10:34
You see? Beautiful.
10:36
Mhm.
10:38
If we had a a white pepper would make an
10:41
Italian flag.
10:44
[Music]
10:48
There you go.
10:49
Mhm.
10:50
Now this.
10:53
And then what are we doing after this?
10:55
After this, we go back to the stove and
10:58
we'll put everything together.
11:01
Okay.
11:02
Okay.
11:02
Follow me.
11:04
[Music]
11:05
All right. Now that we cooked it on both
11:07
sides, you're going to put it in here.
11:09
Yes.
11:10
Just slightly cooked.
11:12
Yes. Yes. Just get a nice a beautiful
11:15
color.
11:16
[Music]
11:18
And we're building more flavors.
11:22
Let's see this one.
11:27
[Music]
11:38
Now I'm going to delaze
11:41
delaze the pot with some white red wine
11:44
today. Okay.
11:46
[Music]
11:58
Okay. So now what I want to do because I
12:02
want to use this pot because it's much
12:04
deeper.
12:06
So I'm going to put this in here.
12:10
That's all. And we keep going with that
12:13
now.
12:15
Okay.
12:16
Okay.
12:17
Beautiful.
12:19
Okay. Now you're going to start with the
12:21
onions.
12:21
Yes. Onions.
12:26
[Music]
12:28
Oh, it smells so good. That wine, I can
12:30
smell it.
12:33
Beautiful, eh?
12:34
Mhm.
12:35
Okay, just for a minute or so.
12:39
You're just breaking it all up.
12:41
Yeah.
12:43
So good.
12:45
And this is beautiful like that. And now
12:47
we have the beautiful peppers.
12:49
Okay.
12:50
[Music]
12:54
That's what I'm going to salt the
12:57
peppers now and the onions.
13:00
Always keep it a little bit because at
13:03
the end if you need more, you can always
13:05
put it.
13:06
Okay.
13:06
Some black pepper goes really well with
13:10
this dish.
13:13
Mix it.
13:17
Can you smell that?
13:18
Mhm.
13:20
We'll let it go just for a minute or so.
13:24
Okay. We'll come back to it.
13:25
Yeah.
13:28
[Music]
13:31
With the homemade sauce going in there.
13:33
Oh, yeah.
13:35
Okay. I started with one.
13:37
Yeah.
13:38
But I think we need two.
13:39
Okay.
13:41
Cuz that's too thick.
13:43
So, you did a jar of water.
13:45
Yeah. Just
13:46
a little too thick.
13:47
Yeah. Now we'll put this beautiful
13:49
chicken in there.
13:51
[Music]
14:00
Those piece of chicken, they're alling
14:02
each other.
14:03
Mhm.
14:03
See, this is all flavor.
14:08
Okay.
14:09
Now, how long do you think to cook for?
14:11
Uh, this is going to cook at least 45
14:13
minutes.
14:14
Okay. Because again, the chicken is from
14:16
the farm, so they're free range and the
14:20
meat feels like it's a little bit
14:22
harder, but has much much more flavor.
14:26
Okay. You going to put another jar
14:28
sauce, you said, or no?
14:29
Um, I don't think so.
14:31
No, we're good.
14:32
I think we're good. We just needed to
14:34
cover it.
14:35
Okay.
14:36
And I'm going to put all my beautiful
14:38
seasoning in there.
14:43
See?
14:44
You put some more water.
14:46
Yeah, because you got to give time to
14:50
for the chicken to cook. Beautiful.
14:54
Still beautiful color.
14:57
Okay.
14:59
So, here we have now.
15:03
Let me see what I got. Uh, four
15:07
beautiful green bay leaf.
15:10
If you crack them like this a little
15:13
bit, there's more flavor that comes out.
15:18
Okay. So, you put those ones in. Uh I
15:23
have some beautiful rosemary.
15:27
I just put it to the corner
15:31
and oregano.
15:34
And we'll put it here.
15:38
Look how gorgeous.
15:42
It's like a painting.
15:44
Mhm.
15:45
And you are the artist.
15:47
No, you are the artist, not me. Okay.
15:52
So, now we put
15:55
the basil. You can put anything you
15:57
like.
16:00
See? Leave them here. And this I like to
16:04
put them like that.
16:10
What do you think, baby?
16:11
Beautiful. Looks great. Smells great.
16:13
Now you're going to put the olives.
16:14
Yes.
16:17
And this is another thing that gives
16:19
beautiful flavor. And again, not
16:23
everybody has this.
16:26
If you do, it's amazing. If you don't,
16:29
it's okay. You can buy the calamar
16:32
olives which they're really really
16:36
tasty.
16:37
[Music]
16:39
Okay.
16:41
And we'll put some more.
16:44
Now we'll put some salt.
16:49
Do you have homemade bread?
16:52
Well, cuz of you I do.
16:56
[Music]
16:58
Now we'll mix it all together. Yeah.
17:00
Nice and gentle. See, you don't want to
17:04
disturb it too much. Okay. It's just
17:08
perfect.
17:08
Yep.
17:09

17:27
rosemary. Yes.
17:29

18:15
It doesn't matter how you do it
18:18
