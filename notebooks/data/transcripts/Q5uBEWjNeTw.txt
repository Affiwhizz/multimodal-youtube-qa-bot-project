Introduction: What Is a Flognarde (flaugnarde)
0:00
Welcome back everyone to the channel.
0:01
This week we're making something sweet
0:03
and we're going to discover something
0:05
that is called the fliard. The fliard is
0:08
a close relative of the cherry cleafuti
0:10
which is kind of a cherry flu coming
0:13
from central France. That recipe is also
0:15
coming from central France. Same
0:16
location but the name fliard is given
0:19
when you make that recipe without using
0:22
cherries. mainly here. This is made
0:25
either with apples, prunes, pears, and
0:27
even sometimes apricots. The other thing
0:30
that changes that the flard is a bit of
0:33
a really rustic countryside affair.
0:36
There's no real rules. It's much more
0:38
laidback. So, ingredients, it is similar
0:40
to a crab batter that can be either thin
0:42
or a bit thicker depending on how you
0:44
like it. And then with that, you just
0:46
pick a fruit, put it into the batter,
0:48
pour this into a, you know, a container
0:50
of any kind, you know, kind of a little
0:53
dish and cook this in the oven and
0:55
you're done. So there's nothing complex
0:57
as you will discover. I will be making
0:59
here two versions to show you the two
Making the Batter
1:00
main flavors that we have. I'm going to
1:03
make one with apple and one with the
1:05
prune because the prune is like really a
1:07
classic and it's ultra super easy. So
1:09
let's get on let's get started. Now the
1:11
first thing we're going to do here is to
1:13
make the batter. So, we're using a bowl
1:15
and we're going to start by adding uh
1:17
the dry ingredients. So, I've got first
1:19
the flour. So, the flour.
1:22
You want to sift it.
1:25
After that, we're going to have
1:27
the sugar
1:30
and the salt. Okay. And we're going to
1:32
mix everything together. And then we've
1:34
got eggs on the sides. I'm going to beat
1:36
them with a fork. And I'm going to add
1:37
them in.
1:40
Okay. That in the middle up. And we're
1:43
going to whisk.
1:46
Now for the whisking, you start from the
1:47
middle and you go in circular motion
1:50
like this. And you grab some flour as
1:51
you go. And to avoid any clumps or
1:54
anything like this. So a bit of time.
1:58
And we keep on going until almost all
2:00
the flour is in before we add the milk.
2:03
Once you're done, uh, you've got a base
2:05
batter that's kind of thick. You see
2:07
it's nice and smooth. And all what you
2:09
need to do from here is to add the milk.
2:11
Now, typically the milk is added cold
2:13
like straight into it like a crab
2:14
butter. But I've learned a little trick
2:16
from a little grandma trick from that
2:17
recipe is that it is best to actually
2:20
warm up the milk first so that the
2:22
batter is not really cold when we put it
2:25
in the oven. We we have it already kind
2:27
of nice and warm. So, it's going to hit
2:29
the ground running and really set very
2:31
fast and have this good bubbling effect
2:34
in the oven. So, I'm going to warm up
2:36
the milk and I'm going to add some
2:37
butter into it. So, really nothing
2:39
complex on here. small pan.
2:42
All of the milk in. And typically your
2:44
grand metric again, a good tablespoon of
2:46
butter in here. I'm going to bring this
2:48
to a light boil. And that's it.
2:51
My milk has had a very light boil. The
2:53
butter is melted. That's it. I'm turning
2:55
the heat off. We're adding this to the
2:56
butter. Very nice. Whisking a little bit
Preparing the Fruits: Apple & Prune Variations
3:00
of that. I'm going to take
3:02
my milk in here.
3:04
And bit by bit, I'm going to add it in.
3:07
Now the other little trick at the end
3:09
you always add a little bit of liquor.
3:10
Typically rum is good. I don't have any
3:12
today. So I'm going to add a teaspoon
3:15
of kers k
3:18
liquor like it for that kind of thing.
3:21
And we're going to leave this to rest
3:23
now for a good 15 minutes or 20 minutes
3:26
really to improve the batter. And I'm
3:27
going to take up the fruit. Now for the
3:29
fruit is very straightforward. I'm going
3:31
to make a prune version and an apple
3:33
version. For the prune or what you need
3:34
to do is to soak the prune. And I'm
3:36
soaking them here in cherry, which is
3:37
like port wine. But you use, you can use
3:40
armaniac, cognac, brandy, or even warm
3:42
water if you don't want to use any
3:44
alcohol. And that's all you need to do.
3:46
And you need to let them to soak like 15
3:47
minutes. And then we add this into the
3:49
batter. And we cook. We're done. If you
3:52
make an apple one, you can choose an
3:53
apple acidic. These are jazz apple or
3:57
something bit more sweet like the gala
3:58
apple. And you can peel them, you know,
4:01
core the apple and either slice the
4:03
apple thinly and add them into the dish
4:05
or cut the apples in mediumsized chunk.
4:08
It is up to you. You can put the apple
4:10
raw or you can pre-cook the apple like
4:13
I'm going to do now on the stove in a
4:15
bit of butter, some sugar, and you can
4:17
add some liquor into this, but this is a
4:19
bit of an extra step. Okay, so for me
4:21
here, let me show you how I'm making the
4:24
apple my way. Okay. So, for me, my
4:27
preference is to have the apple in
4:28
chunks. So, I've quarted the apples, cut
4:31
them into chunks, and here they're
4:32
sitting in a buff of lemons. I've added
4:34
some lemon juice in here and to mix the
4:36
whole and avoid discoloration. And I'm
4:38
just going to do a quick saute in butter
4:40
and sugar in a pan. Let's go. So,
4:42
nothing complex for the apple. A pan, a
4:44
good tablespoon of butter, high heat,
4:46
and I'm adding my apple. I don't want to
4:48
add too much lemon juice. And I'm going
4:51
to stir the dish for what maybe
4:54
five minutes or something like this just
4:56
to color the apple slightly. When it
4:58
start to chant after 2 minutes something
5:00
a little sprinkle of sugar because I
5:03
want some caramelization
5:06
and that's going to be it. Continue
5:08
cooking and I might do a little fl for
5:09
the end. Okay, almost done. So I'm going
5:12
to add some coveros in here.
5:16
[Applause]
5:17
Bit of a flambe
5:20
and that's it. My heat is off. So just
5:23
after the flambe we got some coloration
5:25
on here and that's all we need. We're
5:27
not destroying the apple. We don't want
5:28
to melt them away because they still
5:29
need to cook for a good 15 20 minutes in
Choosing the Right Pan and Preparing for Baking
5:31
the oven into the batter. So I'm going
5:33
to transfer this into a little bowl and
5:35
we're ready. So once you're here, you've
5:37
got your butter ready and your fruits
5:39
that are ready, you're good to go. So if
5:41
you like to wait for for instance some
5:43
guests to arrive or anything like that
5:45
and you can leave everything uh like
5:46
this even at room temperature it's fine
5:48
and you cover this with a towel and
5:50
whenever you're ready where you pick a
5:51
dish and you prepare it and then you
5:53
bake. So let me show you now how to
5:54
prepare the dish. Now when it comes to
5:56
the dishes while it is said that you can
5:58
use any uh kind of dish such as ceramic
6:00
porcelain tart pan or anything like
6:03
this. Let me tell you that cast iron is
6:05
the only thing that's going to give you
6:06
the true result with the butter bubbling
6:08
up, coloring, etc., etc., because it
6:10
captures the heat. It's, you know, it
6:12
keeps the heat and it heats up in an
6:14
instant compared to these things. If you
6:16
use this, you're going to end up with
6:17
some kind of a flat cake looking like
6:20
thing. If you use that, you're going to
6:21
have this kind of bubbling crazy pizza-
6:23
like kind of look. Totally different.
6:25
So, my preference cast iron small one
6:28
individual
6:29
large skillet for three or four. And
6:31
now, let's prepare the dish. Remember,
6:33
when it comes to baking, even something
6:35
simple like this, you cannot put your
6:37
guard down until you cross the finish
6:39
line. So, we've got the right dish. So,
6:41
we're going to put all the uh the
6:43
success on our side. That the easy
6:44
stuff. And the thing we're going to do
6:46
here, wash your hands. And we're going
6:47
to generously, let me reiterate,
6:50
generously coat this with butter
6:53
absolutely everywhere on the inside.
6:55
Once your pan has been coated with
6:57
butter, doesn't matter if it's a small
6:58
one or a big one, you're going to do a
7:00
coating of sugar. So, you start I'm
7:03
using a plate under so there's plenty of
7:05
sugar in here, absolutely everywhere.
7:08
And I'm just going to tap
7:10
the excess. Okay, that's the end result.
7:14
Now that you've got the pan ready and
7:15
the fruit, we almost ready to bake.
7:18
You're going to preheat your oven at
7:19
200°. And keep in mind that this is
7:21
something called a dish that is
7:23
alaminate on demand. I mean if you want
7:25
to impress friends, you can do it at the
7:27
last minute in the kitchen. Maybe for a
7:28
date night. You want to impress, you
Baking and Final Tips for Perfect Texture
7:30
disappear in the kitchen. Oh, let me
7:31
make something quickly. Boom. You make
7:32
this in an instant. It's going to come
7:34
out wonderful. All right. But before we
7:36
can assemble, there's one last thing we
7:38
need to do with the batter. So just
7:40
before we assemble and we bake this,
7:42
very important that applies to all kinds
7:44
of batter, crab batters and this butter.
7:46
After it's resting, you will see that
7:48
now my batter is liquid,
7:52
but it's kind of thickish. See, look how
7:56
it coats the thing. That's too thick. If
7:58
you use something like this, you're
8:00
going to end up with a cake. Now, that's
8:02
that's going towards the cake batter too
8:03
much. So what you do just before you add
8:06
up to a 50 mil or more of milk
8:12
to get back that kind of watery style
8:15
kind of batter. You see before it was
8:17
really coated. See how like it's very
8:18
it's much thinner there. That's what you
8:20
want. So we're going to use the prunes.
8:22
So I'm having my my dish on here. I'm
8:24
really draining the excess of uh you
8:27
know of of juice that I've got in there.
8:29
And when I'm done I'm just going to
8:31
cover
8:34
up. Cover the whole lot. It's a bit like
8:36
making craps, like pancakes. So, sort of
8:38
cover, not too much. You only You want
8:40
to see them a little bit like this.
8:42
Boom. And that goes straight into the
8:44
oven. Cooking time. It should not take
8:46
more than 10 minutes. 200°C. Let's go.
8:49
Very hot. Just out of the oven. I'm
8:51
trying to turn it around to show you.
8:53
And this is the effect of the cast iron
8:56
skillets. It has to be served really
8:58
warm. So, what you can do, you can bring
9:00
this to the table straight away. Be
9:02
careful. That's uh that's very very hot.
9:03
As you can leave it to cool down a
9:05
little bit and then we can dig in. So
9:06
we'll prepare an apple one after that
9:08
and some degation. So when it's all
9:10
cooled down, if it's deflating, I'm
9:11
going to have a quick bite here on the
9:13
in the kitchen with this one and then
9:14
we'll do the apple. I've got a whole
9:16
setup with a nice background for the
9:17
apple. But just to give you a first
9:19
look, uh it's like a kind of a it is a
9:23
bit like a pancake as you as you can
9:25
see. Okay. And then you just bite in
9:27
when it's really warm. So, for the
9:28
apple, exact same process, same amount.
Tasting & What Makes This Rustic French Dessert Special
9:31
And keep in mind, the amount of apple is
9:32
half an apple per person. The other one
9:34
took me 12 minutes. Let's have a look
9:35
how long this one takes. Whoa. Very hot.
9:38
Just out of the oven. And really, the
9:40
magic of the cast iron happen almost
9:42
like a pizza. You can see all of these
9:45
things. So, I'm going to have it to
9:46
leave it to cool down for just a few
9:48
minutes before we can dig in. All right.
9:50
So, when you leave it to cool, the
9:51
primary seat deflates. So, I had to It's
9:53
still very hot, but I had to kind of
9:56
wait and uh and it's that's like that
9:59
skillet where I like that. Ah, it's hot.
10:02
That's kind of one person thing. And
10:03
then you get it
10:06
kind of gooey/ elastic slash delicious
10:10
kind of apple fly.
10:17
It's really It's really like um
10:22
like a crepe.
10:24
But more sugar.
10:27
The more sugar the better.
10:30
So, have some more.
10:33
It's hot. Further away. Wow.
10:37
Honestly,
10:39
caramelized
10:42
kind of gooey. Nice. You can adjust the
10:45
consistency if you want it to a bit more
10:46
runny, a bit more flike, more milk, more
10:49
fruits if you want. See, the apples are
10:51
nicely cooked with the the technique in
10:53
the pan.
10:54
And um
10:57
it's really good. Well, by now I'm
10:59
totally full with the prunes and apple
11:01
fess. Very buttery and indulgent, but
11:03
what a result. If you've never tried it,
11:05
honestly, it is worth the experience.
11:08
The batter can be done thinner, thicker.
11:10
It is up to you to decide different size
11:12
in small skillets, larger one. There's
11:14
plenty of freedom. So, if you try the
11:15
recipe, let me know what you think in
11:18
the comment section. And of course, if
11:19
you want to see more of those, let me
11:21

11:24
I'm trying to make them a little bit
11:26
shorter. And that's it for me. I see you
11:28
next time. Take care all. Bye-bye,
11:32
