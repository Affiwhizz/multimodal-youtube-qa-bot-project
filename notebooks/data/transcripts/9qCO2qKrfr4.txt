I love ratatouille. I eat ratatouille probably  in the summertime at least five times a week. 
0:21
My favorite thing about Ratatouille is  that it can be served with almost anything.
0:25
It can be vegan, vegetarian or it can be served with meat.

I'm Viktorija Todorovska, I write about food.

I'm a cook and today I'll show you how to make ratatouille,
0:33
one of the specialties of Nice.
0:36
Nice is situated on the Mediterranean  coast in Provence, France. 
0:40
It's said that ratatouille's  origins can be traced back to here –
0:44
it was first served in the eighteenth century.
0:47
Viktorija Todorovska teaches  classes at a culinary school –
0:51
where ratatouille is one of the top recipes. 
0:55
What makes it so popular is that it uses all of  the things
0:59
that everybody here grows in their backyard,
1:02
and it's kind of the flavor of the area.
1:06
These are the ingredients:
1:16
Viktorija Todorovska  gets her vegetables at the market – it's open six days a week. 
1:21
The warm and dry climate  of Provence means regional  
1:24
products are available here almost all year round. 
1:33
Ratatouille is all about ingredients. So you want to get the freshest,  
1:36
ripest ingredients you can, because  that's what gives the flavor. 
1:44
So the first step is just to clean  the vegetables and then chop them  
1:49
into more or less equal-size pieces. That way they will all… when you  
1:55
take a bite of ratatouille you’re  getting a taste of each vegetable. 
2:01
Authentic ratatouille is  made with “trumpet zucchini.” 
2:04
This is a courgette that only grows in  Nice and in a small portion of Italy,  
2:09
next to the border, and it's firmer in texture  and stronger in flavor than regular zucchini. 
2:17
She roughly dices the red onion. And chops up the garlic super small. 
2:24
The eggplant comes last, because it  turns brown fast once you cut it up. 
2:32
Ratatouille always starts with what is a key  
2:34
ingredient in Niçois cooking and  that's extra-virgin olive oil. 
2:38
You never put eggplant in cold oil  because if you do the eggplant will  
2:43
soak up all of the oil and it'll be heavy  and you'll have to keep adding more oil. 
2:48
And she says it’s very important to cook  and season each vegetable separately. 
2:53
I personally like to salt each  ingredient separately, because then
2:58
when you combine them,  
2:59
everything is correctly salted. So what’s still missing?
3:04
So what’s still missing?
3:07
We'll add either fresh tomatoes in the  summer or tomato sauce in the winter. 
3:12
And then we'll keep it at really low  temperature, for about five to seven minutes. 
3:17
The tomato sauce will bring them together and that's what makes ratatouille ratatouille. 
3:29
Mhhh, that is perfect!
3:34
This vegetable dish can be served hot or cold
3:37
and as a side dish to fish or meat. And Viktorija Todorovska has a special tip. 
3:43
She recommends making a ratatouille  baguette sandwich with goat’s cheese. 
3:47
Great for picknicks!
3:50
Now comes the real test. Bon appétit!
4:02
To me, this ratatouille proves that you can make it at any time of year.
4:05
And if you choose good ingredients it reminds you  
4:09
of summer and sunshine and  good weather and the beach.
