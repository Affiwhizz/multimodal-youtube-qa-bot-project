how's it going you're awesome bunch of
0:01
Bakers I hope you're having a great day
0:03
so far welcome back to the channel in
0:05
today's video we're making pasta's
0:06
denata or Portuguese custard Tarts so
0:08
let's go to the kitchen and get started
0:11
Portuguese custard Tarts are quite
0:13
unique that they are very light the
0:15
custard doesn't contain any cream and
0:17
it's not very sweet either and the
0:19
pastry is even slightly salty this makes
0:21
them a perfect snack and it is very easy
0:24
to eat way too many of them the classic
0:26
way of serving them is with a little bit
0:28
of icing sugar and a sprinkling of
0:30
cinnamon and of course alongside a nice
0:32
coffee this is one of those treats that
0:34
has a long history attached to it but as
0:36
you know this ain't no History Channel
0:38
this is just my interpretation of a
0:40
Portuguese custard tart and I just try
0:42
to make it as close to the real deal as
0:44
I could and I'm going to give you all
0:45
the instructions that you need to make
0:47
it too and the result here is fantastic
0:49
the custard is extremely smooth and
0:51
light and the pastry case is so crunchy
0:54
that it shatters as you bite down into
0:55
it all great characteristics of a proper
Ingredients
0:58
pastel so let's just see what we need to
1:00
make them for the pastry we'll need some
1:02
plain flour all-purpose flour some salt
1:05
a bit of water and some soft butter for
1:08
the filling we'll need a bit of flour
1:09
and with the milk to make a roux we'll
1:12
need some sugar water and a cinnamon
1:14
stick for making a syrup we'll need some
1:16
more milk some vanilla paste or a
1:19
vanilla pod if you can afford that and
1:21
some egg yolks that is all when it comes
Equipment
1:23
to the ingredients it's a very simple
1:25
recipe as the equipment only the bowl
1:27
scales dough scraper a brush a sieve a
1:31
jug a rolling pin a couple of pots a
1:34
whisk and perhaps most importantly we'll
1:36
need something to bake the pastries in
1:38
fast tastes are made using special molds
1:41
and I'm not going to invest money into
1:42
something that we use once or twice so
1:45
regular sized muffin case is perfect for
1:47
the job and yes they won't have the
1:49
exact same shape as they should but it
1:51
doesn't matter they'll still taste as
1:53
they should now here's the side just for
1:55
reference two and a half inches or about
1:57
six centimeters across and about an inch
2:00
and a half almost four centimeters deep
2:02
of course you can make more smaller ones
2:04
but I wouldn't make them any bigger they
2:06
should be small snack size Tarts okay
2:08
with all that out of the way let's start
2:10
making the pastry a new already know
2:12
it's going to be made using the no need
2:13
method in a bowl combine the water the
2:16
salt give it all a good mix make sure
2:18
the salt is completely dissolved this is
2:20
the best chance to do it then add the
2:22
flour and mix Again mix until there's no
2:25
dry flour left you can finish it by hand
2:27
just to ensure that everything is nice
2:28
and smooth it's not going to be
2:30
perfectly smooth so don't expect that
2:31
and it will be quite sticky but don't
2:34
worry that's normal that is all there is
2:36
to making the dough place it back into
2:37
the bowl cover it up leave it to rest
2:39
for 30 minutes the gluten will of course
2:41
develop itself we're not even going to
2:43
fold this dough it'll go from a Shaggy
2:46
mess to a stretchy dough in about 30
2:48
minutes and then we'll roll it out and
2:50
turn it into a pastry it could not be
2:52
easier so here's the next step dust your
2:55
table heavily with flour and dust the
2:57
dough ball as well then flatten it in
2:59
kind of a square shape and grab your
3:01
rolling pin and roll it out to a big
3:03
square and don't worry about
3:05
measurements just roll it out until it's
3:07
very very thin if it's resisting giving
3:09
you a hard time just leave it to rest
3:11
for a while and then continue rolling
3:12
but saying that it should not resist
3:14
we're using weak flower and we didn't
3:16
need this dough so it should be very
3:17
stretchy okay now we can start the
3:19
buttering process take your soft butter
3:21
and brush two thirds of the dough with
3:24
it a quick note on the consistency of
3:25
the butter ideally you don't want it to
3:28
be as soft as the one I'm using and
3:30
definitely not any softer than that
3:31
because it may just start squeezing out
3:33
as you roll the pastry I was a bit
3:35
impatient I put in a microwave okay grab
3:37
the one third of dough that wasn't
3:39
brushed with butter and Fold It Down
3:41
make sure it's nice and straight Pat it
3:43
down to get rid of any large air bubbles
3:45
then take the remaining loose third of
3:47
dough and fold it up we have our first
3:49
three layers now we can call this a
3:51
pastry right to continue heavily dusted
3:54
with flour again you really don't want
3:56
this to stick what you want to do from
3:57
now is roll this rectangle into a larger
4:00
rectangle again don't worry about the
4:02
size make it as flat as you can if it's
4:04
resisting again just leave it to rest
4:06
for a few minutes and then continue but
4:08
if you manage to roll it out let's
4:10
continue the buttering process process
4:12
and once again we want to cover
4:13
two-thirds of the surface with butter
4:15
and repeat the same steps as earlier
4:17
take the uncovered part of pastry fold
4:20
it over and then fold over the other
4:22
side now we have nine layers and from
4:24
here would be impossible to roll it out
4:26
anymore so we're going to wrap it up in
4:28
some cling film leaving in the fridge to
4:30
chill for a while this will make the
4:32
gluten relax to make it easier to work
Finishing the pastry
4:34
with a 30 minutes of chilling will be
4:36
more than enough for this it's been
4:38
about half an hour now we can finish the
4:40
pastry use plenty of flour it's your
4:42
best friend in this recipe that's the
4:44
pastry generously then grab your rolling
4:46
pin and roll it out to a big square or
4:49
big rectangle doesn't really matter as
4:51
long as it has straight edges and as
4:53
long as it's nice and thin you can
4:55
straighten out by hand once you're
4:56
finished we need to butter the
4:58
spreadsheet once more but this time
5:00
butter the whole surface don't leave
5:02
nothing uncovered in order to make it
5:04
nice and even nice and neat nice and
5:06
perfect trim the top and the bottom
5:08
edges this pizza cutter is a great tool
5:11
for the job if you're gonna use a knife
5:12
don't mess up your table okay next up we
5:15
need to roll this up into a nice tight
5:17
roll start on the bottom you want to
5:19
gently fold over a tiny Edge the smaller
5:22
and Tighter you make this the better
5:23
it's not easy with those sausage fingers
5:25
all you need to do now is keep rolling
5:27
it nice and evenly don't rush take your
5:30
time once you get to the end you can
5:32
pinch the seam together just to make
5:34
sure that it doesn't come undone make
5:35
sure it's nice and straight now wrap it
5:37
up and clean film because we need to
5:39
chill this one more time if we try to
5:40
divide it now it would make a mess so
5:43
chilling it is essential and you can
5:45
easily make this way ahead of time if
5:46
you want to just keep it in the fridge
5:48
until you need it by chilling it for as
Making the custard
5:50
little as one hour should be enough and
5:52
whilst it's chilling let's make the
5:54
custard it starts with the paste made of
5:56
flour and milk this is going to help
5:58
thicken the custard combine the flour
6:01
and milk and then whisk until smooth
6:02
leave it on the side until later next
6:05
grab a pan and combine the milk with the
6:07
vanilla paste set it down on medium to
6:10
high heat leave them until it started
6:12
boiling as soon as it comes up to a boil
6:14
take it off and as soon as you take it
6:17
off whisk it into the paste that we just
6:19
made doing it this way prevents the
6:21
custard from becoming lumpy it would
6:23
have been easier to just combine all
6:24
these ingredients in a pot and bring
6:25
them up to a boil but the mix would not
6:27
turn out smooth okay next up let's make
6:30
the syrup in another pot combine the
6:32
sugar cinnamon stick and the water and
6:35
we also need to bring this up to a boil
6:37
once the syrup starts bubbling leave it
6:40
to cook for a few seconds and then
6:41
remove the cinnamon stick if you don't
6:43
have cinnamon sticks you can just use
6:45
little powdered cinnamon okay combine
6:47
this mix with the mix that we made
6:49
earlier at this point it'll be pretty
6:51
hot if we add eggs to this they might
6:53
scramble so we should let this cool down
6:56
a little bit before we add the egg yolks
6:57
66 degrees is not too bad I'll just
7:00
leave it to cool down to slightly below
7:02
that and that'll be less than 140
7:04
degrees Fahrenheit for my American
7:06
friends and don't worry about those
7:08
cinnamon sticks floating around we'll
7:10
pass them to a sieve okay once the mix
7:12
has cooled down add the final ingredient
7:14
the egg yolks and then whisk them in
7:16
until everything's nice and smooth you
7:18
can also make this custard a couple days
7:19
ahead of time leave it in the fridge
7:21
just make sure you pass it through a
7:23
sieve to get rid of all the sticks and
7:24
stuff I like to pour it straight into
7:26
The Jug so it's ready to be used okay
7:28
let's cover this and leave it until we
7:30
need it we can move on with finishing
7:32
the pastry cases now get the pastry out
7:34
the fridge trim the edges and then
7:37
divide the pastry into 12 equal pieces
7:39
and you know the drill first cut it in
7:42
half then cut each half and half then
7:45
cut each quarter into three equal pieces
7:47
if you start cutting for one end and
7:49
expect to get 12 in the end it's not
7:51
gonna work this is the best way of
7:53
getting equal sized pieces and there you
7:55
have it we have made little pastry box
7:57
with many many layers next let's prep
Shaping the pastry
8:00
the case by brushing it with butter this
8:03
is probably not totally necessary I just
8:05
did it just in case too much work has
8:07
gone into this to end up in
8:08
disappointment now place the pieces of
8:10
pastry into the muffin tray and here
8:13
comes the fun part using your thumbs you
8:15
want to mold the pastry until it fits
8:17
the tin perfectly be gentle don't tear
8:20
hole in the bottom because the custard
8:22
will leak through it and burn it is
8:24
quite delicate quite soft so just go
8:26
slowly go gradually press it gently work
8:29
your way around in a circle and try to
8:32
go in the same direction be clockwise or
8:34
anti-clockwise if you start going the
8:36
opposite way layers of pastry might
8:38
start flaking off and I know that's
8:40
exactly what I did just now but don't do
8:42
as I do do as I say it is quite simple
8:45
process it just takes a little bit of
8:47
time and patience that's the first one
8:49
done let's keep going try to make the
8:51
bottom as thin as you can because it
8:54
takes the longest time to bake there is
8:56
just enough custard mix to fill up all
8:58
of them don't fill them up all the way
8:59
leave about half centimeter from the rim
9:02
that's about 0.2 of an inch okay these
9:04
bad boys are ready for the oven and they
9:06
must be baked at a very high temperature
Baking
9:08
250 degrees Celsius fan off that's 482
9:12
degrees Fahrenheit we'll bake them for
9:14
around 10 to 12 minutes you will see
9:16
that custard starting to char on top it
9:19
should have little burnt spots on it you
9:21
can turn the tray around halfway to the
9:23
bake to make them color evenly and if
9:25
you think that 250 degrees Celsius is
9:27
bit high for custard Tarts that's
9:29
exactly how they should be baked in fact
9:31
they should be baked at an even higher
9:33
temperature for a shorter time but my
9:35
oven doesn't get any hotter than that so
9:37
it is what it is this is what they
9:38
should look like when they're done you
9:40
can remove them from the muffin case
9:41
straight away they will keep their shape
9:43
leave them on the rack to cool down and
9:45
enjoy whilst they're still warm but
9:47
they'll still be good when they're cold
9:48
too and that's how you make pasta's
9:50
denata or some little super crunchy
9:53
pastry smooth custard tart I can't
Tasting
9:56
stress this enough just look at that
9:57
pastry I should have recorded the sound
10:00
it was like a mini lightning strike
10:01
these bad boys are awesome and trust me
10:04
once you make them you'll fall in love
10:06
all you need to do is get into the
10:08
kitchen and start baking
10:10
