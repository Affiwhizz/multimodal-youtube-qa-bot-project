We're making a simmered pork sandwich
0:08
I've never heard of before. Look out,
0:11
son. We're eating
0:17
large. Max found this. It's a Portuguese
0:21
buff. Be bonus. Think of this. It's a
0:24
pork sandwich. thin slices of pork that
0:26
are simmerred lovingly for oh 30 45
0:30
minutes in this beautifully rich tomato
0:33
sauce that has wine and beer in it.
0:35
Hearken back to an earlier episode when
0:38
young Chant Max doesn't like them to be
0:39
called episodes. That's my TV coming out
0:41
in me. hearken back to an earlier time
0:44
when a video we did was making a
0:47
sandwich Chance had when he was in
0:49
Portugal. That was called the Francesca
0:51
and that was ham and steak and sausage
0:54
piled up on bread and there was this
0:56
tomato beer gravy over the top. Wow,
0:59
that was good. It was one of the
1:00
greatest things we've made in terms of a
1:02
sandwich. We love making sandwiches from
1:04
around the world and today this bifanas
1:07
porto style because there's a couple
1:08
different styles is going to be great.
1:10
We thin up some pork. We make this
1:12
beautiful broth stuff. The pork goes in,
1:14
simmers away. We slam it into some bread
1:16
and we're eating large. Or as they'd say
1:19
in
1:20
Portugal, large. I I don't know how they
1:22
The English speakers in Portugal would
1:24
say large. Okay, come on. Enough of
Slicing & Flattening Pork
1:26
this. That is a one pound piece of pork
1:29
loin. It's beautiful. Now, we want this
1:31
thin. So, you have a couple options. You
1:33
could get this mostly frozen and then
1:34
you can cut it super thin. You could use
1:36
a slicer. But if you don't have any of
1:38
that and you don't want to freeze it,
1:40
here's what you can do. We're gonna cut
1:41
these guys fairly here. Let me just line
1:43
up perfect so Max can see. Fairly thin
1:45
like this. And then we're gonna pound
1:47
them out. You know what that's like?
1:48
We're gonna use a Ziploc bag. So just
1:50
cut till you've got enough. This one
1:53
pound will probably make three or four
1:55
sandwiches. Sandwiches. Sandwiches. So
1:58
we'll cut enough for what our needs
2:00
today and we'll carry on. But you
2:02
usually cut what we need for like seven
2:04
days. Stop it. Okay, that's about half.
2:06
Let's pound these guys out. And I'm
2:08
going to use a Ziploc
2:09
bag. Perfecto. That's great. Off they'll
2:13
come. Look at how nice that is. I'll
2:15
just put them right here. Oh, I'll carry
2:17
on until I'm
2:20
done. Here's what I started with, and
2:22
that's where we're headed. Just like
2:24
that. Just keep
2:26
going. All ready to go. Let's make our
2:28
sauce. First into our pot, some olive
Building & Cooking Sauce
2:31
oil. And then a fairly traditional add
2:33
some lard. That happens to be pork lard
2:36
because why not? And as this melts, come
2:38
on. Melt, melt, melt. Ah, we can jump in
2:41
with our onions. But what's not
2:42
traditional is the amount of onions I'm
2:44
using. I'm using about twice as much
2:47
because I want to pull some out early to
2:49
go into the bottom of the sandwich when
2:51
we start to make it. The rest of the
2:53
onions will be immersion blended with
2:55
everything else. But for now, we'll just
2:56
soften. These get about 4 or 5 minutes.
2:59
Those are nicely softened. Now, we'll
3:01
add some garlic. And I know sort of a
3:03
decent amount because remember, half of
3:05
it's coming out. Don't cry. Just go with
3:07
it. Recipes blow. This only gets about a
3:12
minute. Now we can steal about half of
3:16
it. Maybe not half, maybe a third. You
3:19
just want a little bit in the bottom of
3:21
your sandwiches. Great. Let's add some
3:23
spices. Start with a teaspoon of
3:25
cinnamon. I keep saying I don't like
3:26
cinnamon, but I keep using it and it
3:28
just keeps getting better and better.
3:29
Tablespoon of smoked paprika. We have
3:32
cayenne for some heat. We have salt and
3:34
pepper. We may add more later. We mix.
3:36
We're just toasting these up a little
3:38
bit. You can throw them into the broth
3:40
part once it's in instead. But I like
3:43
what it does to the flavors when it's
3:45
not sitting in liquid. That gets about
3:46
30
3:48
seconds. Oh, Jesus. Do you see that? Did
3:52
you shake that up before you gave it to
3:54
him? Chill. Okay, let's continue.
3:56
Prankster. In goes some crushed
3:58
tomatoes. Turn that down a little bit.
4:00
And some beer. Most of it's on the floor
4:02
beside me. That's a drag. That's a drag.
4:04
And occasionally in this they add some
4:07
white wine. I should have done it
4:09
earlier, but I forgot. That's okay. This
4:11
is all going to come to a boil and the
4:13
wine will start to, you know, dissipate
4:15
a bit. We give that a stir. We add some
4:17
bay leaves. These are gorgeous bay
4:19
leaves, man. Huge ones. Bring this to a
4:21
boil. It's getting there. Come on. Come
4:24
on. It's just toying with me. It's
4:26
laughing at me. We're never going to
4:28
boil properly for you. When it comes to
4:30
a boil, we want to give it about four
4:32
minutes and then we'll move on. Careful,
4:33
you're stepping in beer. Sorry. Look how
4:36
rich the color I love. So, let's get rid
4:38
of these bay leaves cuz they are no
4:40
longer useful to us. This one. Come on.
4:43
Where are you? I know you're in here. I
4:45
got you. Okay, bay leaves are gone. We
4:47
can kill the heat for now. Grab our
Blending Sauce
4:50
immersion blender and turn this into a
4:52
smooth sauce. No immersion blender, no
4:55
processor, no problem. You can skip this
4:57
step and you'd be okay. Hold on. I just
4:59
got sprayed. Sorry. You want it to be
5:02
close to
5:03
me. Great
5:04
stuff. Take this out. Heat back on.
5:07
Bring it to a simmer. And when it has,
5:09
we bring our pork back. Now, the only
Adding Pork
5:11
thing you need to know is when you put
5:12
the pieces in, try and do them one at a
5:14
time because you don't want you don't
5:16
want them to clump. You want them to be
5:18
completely separate in here. Look at
5:19
this beautifulness. Oh, gentle little
5:22
pieces of pork into this amazing simmer
5:25
broth. And we were just saying the move
5:27
would be make a bunch of this simmering
5:28
liquid, put it in a deli container and
5:30
freeze it. And then when you want to
5:32
have this, just have to defrost it and
5:34
away you go. It is not going to go bad
5:36
in the freezer, that's for sure. Okay,
5:38
all your pieces are in. Push them down.
5:40
Give everybody a nice stir. I don't want
5:42
it boiling. I want it simmering. And
5:45
when it is, you partially cover it with
5:46
a lid. And we say see you in 3540
5:49
minutes. Why partially cover? Just
5:51
because we want some of the steam to
5:52
come out and it thicken and richen and
5:55
just be really great. And after 40
The Reveal
5:57
minutes, there's what we've got. Look
5:59
how it's thickened. Oh man. Oh man.
6:02
Okay, let me show you how we do this.
6:03
This can move away and we'll take a bun.
6:05
This is not a Portuguese bun, but it's
Building
6:07
crispy and it's
6:09
beautiful. We'll open the guy up partway
6:12
like that. First thing in will be a
6:14
little sauce right out of our pot like
6:16
that. And then, do you remember the
6:18
onions? I heated them up a bit. Not a
6:20
lot, but you don't want cold onions in
6:22
here. And now your pork. So now we just
6:24
take our pieces of pork and we go like
6:26
this. I think that looks beautiful. Say
6:30
porto bifa if I'm saying it right. And
6:32
I'm probably not, but I think I made it
6:34
right. And it certainly looks delicious.
6:36
Well, I'm definitely excited. I love the
6:38
whole smell. The place has smelled like
6:40
cinnamon the whole time this was
6:42
cooking. Let's find out if this is as
6:43
tender and flavorful as I hope it is. I
6:46
just
First Bite
6:53
cleaned. It's better than I thought it
6:56
would be. The pork is so t I've not
6:57
cooked pork like that before. The flavor
6:59
profile is insane. The cinnamon comes
7:01
through. Little bit of heat. Little beer
7:04
wine note in the background, but that
7:05
sauce. I said it before, make a ton
7:08
of it. Freeze it. You'll be glad you
7:10
have it. And the onions are key. I hope
7:12
I didn't offend any Portuguese by adding
7:14
extra onions to the bottom of this, but
7:16
it is so good. Holy This has to be
7:18
in your lineup. It has to be in your
7:20
lineup. Buffana. Buffana. Pork greatness
7:23
is what it should just be called.
