hey guys welcome back to my channel
0:01
today i'll be showing you how to make
0:03
knife
0:04
without using food coloring and without
0:06
flipping it
0:07
let's start cooking on my previous puff
0:11
pastry dessert recipe
0:13
i showed how to make the simple syrup in
0:14
the ishta so i'll put that link down
0:17
below
0:17
these are all the ingredients needed for
0:19
this recipe
0:22
you can find the shredded phyllo dough
0:23
at a local arabic store
0:25
i wait until it softens up a little bit
0:27
that way i could cut it
0:29
or i could put it in a food processor
0:31
and pulse it for a little bit just make
0:32
sure it doesn't get so fine
0:34
sometimes i like to shred it with my
0:36
hands if it's very soft
0:38
add the filler dough in a bowl and then
0:40
add the melted butter on top if you like
0:42
adding the kinetic food coloring
0:44
you would add it here to the butter
0:46
until it turns pink
0:50
[Music]
0:52
i like using my hands to make sure that
0:54
the fillot dough is equally covered with
0:56
butter
0:56
and none of it is dry now i put about a
0:59
third of the phyllo dough mixture onto a
1:01
pan
1:02
i never spray it because it has enough
1:04
butter to keep it from sticking
1:06
just make sure you cover the entire
1:08
surface
1:10
now place the ishta on top i make sure
1:13
it's not so thick that way it makes it
1:15
easy to spread
1:16
just slowly do it that way you don't
1:18
remove the bottom layer
1:27
i actually find this cheese in the
1:28
freezer section at the local area store
1:30
just make sure you taste it to make sure
1:32
it's not too salty
1:33
and that it's not expired because
1:36
unfortunately i
1:37
had to deal with those two problems just
1:39
shred the cheese on top
1:41
and then add the rest of the fillo dough
1:43
on top of everything else
1:54
now it's ready for the oven put in the
1:56
oven uncovered
1:58
on 375 for about 15 to 20 minutes
2:01
until it turns a golden brown
2:04
[Music]
2:07
add some simple syrup on top after it's
2:09
out of the oven
2:10
don't add too much because people can
2:12
always add on the side
2:14
i prefer it not to be so sweet that way
2:16
i can taste the cheese
2:24
sprinkle some unsalted pistachio on top
2:27
you can either cover the entire dessert
2:29
or
2:29
separate it into individual servings
2:32
i like to cover it all that way each
2:35
bite is equal in taste
2:37
[Music]
2:39
it's best served when it's fresh out of
2:41
the oven it's time to dig
2:42
in
