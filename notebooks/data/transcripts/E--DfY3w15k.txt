Hey I'm here! I'm here! I can see you! Oh my god this is the beautiful cannelloni.

Hi lovely people! Today I'm gonna make cannelloni! The most Italian recipe! You can make
0:17
cannelloni with everything. The traditional one is spinach, ricotta, parmesan, a little
0:21
nutmeg. This particular one it is with beef and pork. So what I'm gonna do is,
0:27
I'm gonna have an onion which I'm gonna chop it very finely. Put two-three
0:32
tablespoons of olive oil. Oh I love that noise! Sweat the onions for 3-4 minutes.
0:41
150 grams of pork. This is beef to give it the right balance.
0:46
Sweat the meat for about 10 minutes. Right, now it's half way you get the
0:51
salami. Roughly chop. Because I use it as a savoury, I use it as a salt. You get
0:56
about five-six leaves of sage. Slowly, without touching your fingers. Ahhh! No, only joking!
1:05
Just put them inside. The smell, it is incredible! Unbelievable!
1:12
Put everything inside the bowl. When it's nice and cooled down, we've got lovely ricotta.
1:19
Just start to mix it. The reason why it's cooled down, is because you're gonna crack an egg inside.
1:25
So see you don't want it to be scrambled. Start to mix again. Handful of breadcrumbs.
1:31
Also again it works as a bond. That is done. Simple tomato sauce. You know how to make.
1:38
You know garlic, bit of basil inside, and cook it all together. So simple. Let's fill the
1:43
cannoli now. Where are you? Where are you? Oh my god! It's so beautiful! So first of all you need to
1:52
cut it and start to fill it. Push it down. You just put it in, hold your hands underneath.
1:59
It's so easy. Just put it aside then you carry on doing that.
2:04
Another one goes in. Look at that! Fantastic! Oh my god! So then he gets the rest of the sauce.
2:12
Just make sure goes everywhere because
2:15
the sauce will cook the pasta. So easy! Then cover with foil, put them in the
2:22
oven for about 30 minutes, remove the foil and put it back in the oven for about
2:27
another 10 minutes and you will enjoy it! Ahh! Let's just put a bit of cheese on top.
2:34
Ooh yes! Let's put them in the oven for about few more minutes and then it should
2:41
be ready! Oh my my! Look at this! I want to eat it, and I want to eat it straight away now!
2:51
Oh my my! The smell is unbelievable! Yeah! I'm happy.
3:01
Sorry, but I have to eat it.
3:08
Mmm! The flavour of tomato, the filling of the meats with a little bit of salami inside.
3:17
What can I say? Just make it. Enjoy. Why I'm cooking so good?!
3:22
I don't know, but I do. Bless you all. Arrivederci!
