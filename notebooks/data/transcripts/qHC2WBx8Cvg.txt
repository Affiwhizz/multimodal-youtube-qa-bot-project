4:32
so guys my peas has finally finished
4:35
and it's been cooking guys just over
4:39
one hour and what i did the water
4:42
was reducing so i add at least
4:45
one cup of water to it okay but make
4:49

4:57
and soft
5:04

5:07
exactly oh you want it guys
5:09
so what i'm gonna do i'm gonna firstly
5:12

5:16
milk okay
5:22
give it a stir
5:25
look at that it looks so nice and
5:29
so creamy then i'm gonna add
5:32
all my seasoning
5:36
you want to give it a stir after i add
5:38
my seasoning
5:41
just make sure you remove the outer
5:43
layer from your scallion
5:46

5:49
washed and clean guys so what i'm gonna
5:52
do i'm gonna take my hand

8:11
leave it and allow it to cook
8:13
