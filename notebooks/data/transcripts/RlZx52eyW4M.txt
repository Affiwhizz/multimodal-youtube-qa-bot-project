hi everyone it's Rael of rael's carbon
0:03
Cuisine and today I'm going to show you
0:05
how I made this absolutely delicious
0:08
sweet and sour fish and this was quick
0:11
and so
0:13
easy so in this bowl I have some
0:16
beautiful fish filla that was cut into
0:18
cubes nice and fresh now I'm just going
0:21
to season this with a bit of salt and
0:22
black pepper also I'm going to add a bit
0:24
of fish seasoning and some smoth paprika
0:26
for that lovely color and feel free to
0:29
use your very favorite seasoning we just
0:31
want this F to be nice and
0:35
flavorful and in any sweet and sour
0:37
recipe prepping is crucial now I'm going
0:40
to put this aside now I'm going to make
0:42
a nice flour butter now to a bowl I'm
0:44
going to add about 34 cups of flour 1
0:47
teaspoon baking soda and baking powder
0:50
now I'm going to add a bit of water to
0:52
this and I'm going to create a nice
0:54
thick paste now I am going to pour this
0:58
but over the fish mixing that well then
1:00
I'm going to put that aside and I did
1:03
went ahead and prepped some bell peppers
1:05
onion and garlic and some pineapple
1:07
pieces now for the start of the show The
1:11
Sweet and S sauce to a bowl I'm going to
1:13
add some sugar and ketchup for the
1:15
sweetness some pineapple and vinegar for
1:17
the sour and a bit of soy sauce for
1:20
color I'm going to mix that well and if
1:23
you should taste this this is tasting
1:25
really really nice and the sweet and
1:27
sour recipe is good for chicken and also
1:31
awesome for
1:33
shrimp now that all our ingredients are
1:36
nicely prepped they should only take
1:37
about 8 to 10 minutes now to my pot I'm
1:40
going to add some cooking oil and I'm
1:41
going to allow that to heat up then in
1:43
with the fish pieces and I'm going to
1:45
fry these until they are nice and crispy
1:49
which should only take about 3 to 4
1:51
minutes stirring so they would not stick
1:53
together and try not to curl the pots
1:56
frying in batches if you must you want
1:59
them to be nice and crispy so that way
2:02
you know the the batter will stays on
2:05
and these are perfectly done just going
2:08
to remove them from the
2:10
[Music]
2:16
pot now that we are done I'm going to
2:19
remove all the oil adding back just a
2:21
bit and I'm going to saute the onions
2:23
and garlic also I'm going to add the bar
2:26
and color bell peppers which in fact
2:29
give the sweet and sour sauce amazing
2:32
flavor and this is smelling really
2:36
really
2:37
nice now in with some pineapple pieces
2:40
which is very optional but it really
2:43
gives a great Flavor now for the star
2:46
the sweet and S sauce I'm going to give
2:49
this a nice mix now back in with all the
2:52
fish and I'm going to mix this so
2:55
everything will be nicely coated and to
2:57
believe me one I say this is smelling
3:01
just amazing and that's it it's ready
3:05

3:07
to this or a bit of parsley and just
3:10
